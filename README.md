# SPACEWAR

This is my own HTML reconstruction of Stewart Brand's article on Spacewar,
as published in Rolling Stone on December 7, 1972. It's a fascinating article
that conveys a ton, not just about the game, but about the general culture of
the early-seventies computer labs, back when the West was wild. It's also
immensely prescient: in three paragraphs in a row, it declares in no uncertain
terms that widespread Internet access would spell the end of record stores and
the newspaper industry, while leading to an all-new industry for online gaming.
This is in an article that was written nearly two decades before the first web
site.

I initially discovered the article in the summer of 2011 by following a link
from Wikiquote to [Michael Stern's transcription of the article][stern] on his
personal site. However, it was essentially a straight copy from a shaky OCR
run into a hodgepodge of late-nineties HTML (not a `</p>` in sight), and later
parts of the article got sloppier to the point of being unreadable (with
several paragraphs just outright going missing).

A couple years later, I found myself subscribed to Rolling Stone (a side effect
of becoming a member at Seattle's EMP Museum), which includes an all-access
account to the complete Rolling Stone archives online. I looked up the article
in the archive and set forth to reproduce the entire text of it faithfully to
its original presentation, using my knowledge of good HTML5 and CSS practice to
split the difference between accuracy and extensibility. (I like to think I've
reached that.)

In the spirit of the heady pre-Google days of the early web which this article
calls forward to (and that the original transcription I sourced dated to),
I've added hyperlinks to many of the subjects referenced in the article. This
invites the reader to dive a little deeper into the context of the things
described in the article where doing a further web search for the topic might
not have occurred (I didn't even know Free Schools were a thing in the early
70s until I found that Wikipedia article). Where relevant, links point to
entries in the similarly-toned Jargon File, as originally compiled across sites
contemporaneously with this article and "maintained" by Eric S. Raymond. When
the Jargon File fails at relevance or context, I link to Wikipedia.
