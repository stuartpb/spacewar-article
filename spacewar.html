<p class="intro">
<span class="runin">Ready or</span> not, computers are coming to the people.
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s good news, maybe the best since psychedelics. It&rsquo;s way off
the track of the &ldquo;Computers&mdash;Threat or menace?&rdquo; school of
liberal criticism but surprisingly in line with the romantic fantasies of the
forefathers of the science such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch">Warren McCulloch</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.C.R._Licklider">J.C.R. Licklider</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>.
</p>

<p>
The trend owes its health to an odd array of influences: The youthful fervor
and firm dis-Establishmentarianism of the freaks who design computer science;
an astonishingly enlightened research program from the very top of the Defense
Department; an unexpected market-flanking movement by the manufacturers of
small calculating machines, and an irrepressible midnight phenomenon known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar_(video_game)">Spacewar</a>.
</p>

<p>
Reliably, at any nighttime moment (i.e. non-business hours) in North America
hundreds of computer technicians are effectively out of their bodies, locked in
life-or-death space combat computer-projected onto cathode ray tube display
screens, for hours at a time, ruining their eyes, numbing their fingers in
frenzied mashing of control buttons, joyously slaying their friend and wasting
their employers&rsquo; valuable computer time. Something basic is going on.
</p>

<p>
Rudimentary Spacewar consists of two humans, two sets of control buttons or
joysticks, one TV-like display and one computer. Two spaceships are displayed
in motion on the screen, controllable for thrust, yaw, pitch and the firing of
torpedoes. Whenever a spaceship and torpedo meet, they disappear in an
attractive explosion. That&rsquo;s the original version invented in 1962 at
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell">Steve Russell</a>. (More
on him in a moment.)
</p>

<p>
October, 1972, 8 PM, at <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/">Stanford&rsquo;s Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Laboratory</a>, moonlit and remote in the foothills above
<a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/">Palo Alto, California</a>. Two dozen
of us are jammed in a semi-dark console room just off the main hall containing
AI&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10">PDP&#8209;10</a>
computer. AI&rsquo;s Head System Programmer and most avid Spacewar nut,
<!-- Ralph Gorin is mistakenly referred to as "Ralph Goring" in the printed article -->
Ralph Gorin, faces a display screen which says only:
</p>

<p class="conout"><code>This Console Available.</code></p>

<p>
He logs in on the keyboard with his initials: Click clickclickclick click.
</p>

<p class="conout"><code>
L1,Reg<br>
CSD Fall Picnic. Saturday 11 AM in Flood Park .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</code></p>

<p>
He interrupts further announcements, including one about the &ldquo;First
Intergalactic Spacewar Olympics&rdquo; at 8 PM, with: Click (&ldquo;run&rdquo;)
clickclickclick (&ldquo;Space War Ralph&rdquo;) click (&ldquo;do it&rdquo;).
</p>

<p class="conout"><code>R SWR.<br>
Welcome to spacewar.<br>
How many ships? Maximum is 5.
</code></p>

<p>
Click: 5 (Five players. This is for the first familiarization
battles in the Spacewar Olympics, initiated by me and sponsored (beer &amp;
prizes) by <cite class="smallcaps"><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a></cite>.
Friends, I won&rsquo;t be able to explain every computer-technical term that
comes by. Fortunately you don&rsquo;t need them to get the gist of what&rsquo;s
happening.)
</p>

<p class="conout">
<code>Keyboard buttons? (Else regular). Type Y or N.</code>
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Click: Y</p>

<p class="conout">
<code>
The standard game is:<br>
1 console, 2 torpedo tubes, (normal) scoring, no partial damage, no hyperspace,
killer sun. Ships start in standard positions. Type Y to get a standard game.
</code>
</p>

<p>Ralph wants other features. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Click: N</p>

<p class="conout">
<code>
How many space mines do you want?<br>
Choose from zero to 4.
</code>
</p>

<p>Click: 4</p>
<p class="conout"><code>Partial damage?</code></p>
<p>Click: N</p>
<p class="conout"><code>Display scores?</code></p>
<p>Click: Y</p>
<p class="conout"><code>Two torpedo tubes?</code></p>
<p>Click: N</p>
<p class="conout"><code>Random starting positions?</code></p>
<p>Click: Y</p>

<p>
Immediately the screen goes dark and then displays: Five different spaceships,
each with a dot indicating torpedo tubes are loaded, five scores, each at zero,
a convincing starfield, and four space mines orbiting around a central sun,
toward which the spaceships are starting to fall at a correctly accelerating
rate.
</p>

<p>
Players seize the five sets of control buttons, find their spaceship persona on
the screen, and simultaneously turn and fire toward any nearby still-helpless
spaceships, hit the thrust button to initiate orbit before being slurped by the
killer sun, and evade or shoot down any incoming enemy torpedoes or orbiting
mines. After two torpedoes are fired, each ship has a three second unarmed
&ldquo;reloading&rdquo; time. Fired torpedoes last nine seconds and then disappear.
</p>

<p>
As kills are made the scores start to change. +1 for a successful kill,
<!-- Note: the minus in "-1" is missing in the archive scan I'm looking at. -->
-1 for being killed, +1 for being lone survivor of a battle. Personalities
begin to establish themselves in the maneuvering spaceships: The pilot of the
ship called <i>Pointy Fins</i> is a dead shot but panics easily in cross fire.
<i>Roundback</i> tries to avoid early dueling and routinely fires two torpedoes
&ldquo;around the universe&rdquo; (off the screen, so they reappear lethally unexpected
from the opposite side). <i>Birdie</i> drives for the sun and a fast orbit,
has excellent agility in sensing and facing toward hazard. <i>Funny Fins</i>
shouts a lot, singling out individual opponents. <i>Flatback</i> is silent and
maintains an uncanny field-sense of the whole battlesky, impervious to surprise
attack.
</p>

<p>
A game is over when only one or no survivors are displayed. The screen then
blanks out, counts down 5-4-3-2-1, and redisplays a new battle with ships at
new random positions equidistant from the sun and showing scores accumulative
from previous games. A spaceship that is killed early in a battle will
reincarnate after 16 seconds and rejoin the fray, so that a single battle may
last up to five minutes with a weak player perishing several times in it.
</p>

<p>
The twenty or so raucous competitors in the Spacewar Olympics quickly organize
three events: Five-Player Free-For-All, Team Competition (two against two), and
Singles Competition. The executive officer of the AI Project,
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~learnest/">Les Earnest</a>, who kindly OKed
these Olympics and their visibility, is found to have no immediate function and
is sent out for beer.
</p>

<p>
The setting and decor at AI is Modern Mad Scientist&mdash;long hallways and
cubicles and large windowless rooms, brutal fluorescent light, enormous
machines humming and clattering, robots on wheels, scurrying arcane
technicians. And, also, posters and announcements against the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>,
computer print-out photos of girlfriends, a hallway-long banner

every door in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien">Tolkien</a>&rsquo;s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar">elvish FÃ«anorian script</a>&mdash;the director&rsquo;s office is

the computer room <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor">Mordor</a>.
There&rsquo;s a lot of hair on those technicians, and nobody seems to be
telling them where to scurry.
</p>

<p>
The games progress. A tape recorder kibitzes on the first round of Team
Competition, four ships twisting, converging, evading, exploding:
</p>

<p><i>Where am I? Where am I?</i> Click clickclickclickclick</p>
<p><i>Agh!</i> Clickclickclick clickclick</p>
<p><i>Glitch.</i> Clickclick</p>
<p><i>OK, I won&rsquo;t shoot.</i> Clickclickclick</p>
<p><i>Good work Tovar. Revenge.</i> Clickclick clickclick</p>
<p><i>Cease fire.</i> Click clickclick.</p>
<p><i>Ohhhhhh NO! You killed me, Tovar.</i></p>
<p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry.</i> Clickclickclick</p>
<p><i>Being partners means never having to say you&rsquo;re sorry.</i>
  Clickclickclick </p>

<p><i>Lemme get in orbit.</i> Clickclick</p>
<p><i>Way to dodge.</i> Click clickclickclick</p>
<p><i>Awshit.</i></p>
<p><i>Get tough now.</i> Clickclickclick</p>
<p><i>The other guy was out of torps. I knew it and waited till I got a good
  shot.</i> Clickclick</p>
<p><i>A beaut. O lord.</i> Clickclickclick</p>
<p><i>I shot him but then I slurped.</i> Clickclick clickclick</p>
<p><i>Oooo!</i></p>
<p><i>We win! Tovar and Rem!</i></p>

<p>
Correct. Tovar and Rem won the Team Competition (REM is how Robert E. Maas is
known to the computer and thence to his friends).
<a href="http://www.baumgart.org/">Bruce Baumgart</a>, who by day builds
sensing intelligence into a robot vehicle, won the Free-For-All with a
powerhouse performance. And slim Tovar took the Singles.

Meanwhile, your photographer
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Leibovitz">Annie</a>, was tugged
all over the lab to see the hand-eye rig, the number half-tone printer, various
spectacular geometric display hacks, computer music programs, the color video
image maker .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Four intense hours, much frenzy and skilled
concerted action, a 15-ring circus in ten different directions, the most
bzz-bzz-busy scene I&rsquo;ve been around since
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Pranksters">Merry Prankster</a>
Acid Tests .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and really it&rsquo;s just a normal night at the AI
Project, at any suitably hairy computer research project. Something basic
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
These are heads, most of them. Half or more of computer science is heads. But
that&rsquo;s not it. The rest of the counterculture is laid low and back these
days, showing none of this kind of zeal. What, then?
</p>

<h2 id="the-hackers">
The Hackers
</h2>

<p>
I&rsquo;m guessing that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a> at
<a href="http://www.parc.com/">Xerox Research Center</a> (more on them shortly)
has a line on it, defining the standard Computer Bum:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About as straight as you&rsquo;d expect hotrodders to look. It&rsquo;s
that kind of fanaticism. A true
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">hacker</a> is not a
group person. He&rsquo;s a person who loves to stay up all night, he and the
machine in a love-hate relationship .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They&rsquo;re kids who
tended to be brilliant but not very interested in conventional goals. And
computing is just a fabulous place for that, because it&rsquo;s a place where
you don&rsquo;t have to be a Ph.D. or anything else. It&rsquo;s a place where
you can still be an artisan. People are willing to pay you if you&rsquo;re any
good at all, and you have plenty of time for screwing around.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The hackers are the technicians of this science&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a term
of derision and also the ultimate compliment.&rdquo; They are the ones who
translate human demands into code that the machines can understand and act on.
They are legion. Fanatics with a potent new toy. A mobile new-found elite, with
its own apparat, language and character, its own legends and humor. Those
magnificent men with their flying machines, scouting a leading edge of
technology which has an odd softness to it; outlaw country, where rules are not
decree or routine so much as the starker demands of what&rsquo;s possible.
</p>

<p>
A young science travels where the young take it. The wiser computer research
directors have learned that <em>not</em> trusting their young programmers with
major responsibility can lead immediately to no research. AI is one of perhaps
several dozen computer research centers that are flourishing with their young,
some of them with no more formal education than they got at the local
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_school_movement">Free School</a>.
I&rsquo;m talking to Les Earnest, the gent who went for beer. He&rsquo;s tall,
swarthy, has a black and white striped beard, looks like a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism">Sufi</a> athlete. He&rsquo;s
telling me about what else people build here besides refinements of Spacewar.
There&rsquo;s a speech recognition project. There&rsquo;s the hand-eye project,
in which the computer is learning to see and visually correct its robot
functions. There&rsquo;s work on symbolic computation and grammatical
inference. Work with autistic children, &ldquo;trying to get them to relate to
computers first, and then later to people. This seems to be successful in part
because many of these children think of themselves as machines. You can
encourage them to interact in a game with the machine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another window on the interests of AI and of the hackers is a posted printout
of the file of AI&rsquo;s system programs, some 250 elaborate routines
available. Scanning: <i>Hand Eye Monitor</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Go Game</i>

</p>

<p>
A distinction exists between low-rent and high-rent computer research, between
preoccupations of support group (hackers) and of research group. The
distinction blurs often. Les Earnest: &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to tell
the difference between recreation and work, happily. We try to judge people not
on how much time they waste but on what they accomplish over fairly long
periods of time, like a half year to a year.&rdquo; He adds that Spacewar
players &ldquo;are more from the support groups than the research groups. The
research groups tend to get their kicks out of research.
</p>

<p>Spacewar is low-rent.</p>

<h2 id="spacewar">
Spacewar
</h2>

<p>
Low-rent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but pervasive. Alan Kay: &ldquo;The game of Spacewar
blossoms spontaneously wherever there is a graphics display connected to a
computer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The first opportunity was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
<a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/">Electrical Engineering Department</a> back
in 1961-1962. The earliest mini-computer,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a>&rsquo;s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-1">PDP-1</a>, was installed in the
kludge room with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube">cathode ray tube</a>
display hooked on.
(&ldquo;<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/K/kludge.html">Kludge</a>&rdquo;&mdash;any
lash-up often involving chewing gum, paper clips, scotch tape; it works if no
one trips over a wire; unadaptable; a working mess.) There it was that Steve
Russell and his fellow hackers
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kotok">Alan Kotok</a>,
<a href="http://www.gricer.com/">Peter Samson</a> and Dan Edwards
introduced Spacewar to the world.
</p>

<p>
I phoned Russell at the sprawling old fabric mill in Maynard, Massachusetts,
where Digital Equipment Corporation manufactures the most popular research and
education computers on the market. Russell currently is a researcher for them
working on man-machine interface problems&mdash;adapting computer nature to fit
human nature. Back in 1962 he was a hacker, 23 or so, a math major two years
out of <a href="http://dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth</a> working in the brand new
field of computer science for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John McCarthy</a>
at MIT.
</p>

<p>
His account of the invention of Spacewar is not only intriguing history, it&rsquo;s
the most sophisticated analysis of good game design I&rsquo;ve ever run
across&mdash;elegant work. But that&rsquo;s in retrospect; back then it was
just kids staying up all night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We had this brand new PDP-l,&rdquo; Steve Russell recalls. &ldquo;It was
the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicomputer">mini-computer</a>,
ridiculously inexpensive for its time. And it was just sitting there. It had a
console typewriter that worked right, which was rare, and a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_tape">paper tape</a> reader and a
cathode ray tube display. [There had been CRT displays before, but primarily in
the Air Defense System.] Somebody had built some little pattern-generating
programs which made interesting patterns like a kaleidoscope. Not a very good
demonstration. Here was this display that could do all sorts of good things! So
we started talking about it, figuring what would be interesting displays. We
decided that probably you could make a two-dimensional maneuvering sort of
thing, and decided that naturally the obvious thing to do was
spaceships.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naturally?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had just finished reading
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Smith">&lsquo;Doc&rsquo; Smith</a>&rsquo;s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lensman_series"><cite>Lensman</cite> series</a>.
He was some sort of scientist but he wrote this really dashing brand of science
fiction. The details were very good and it had an excellent pace. His heroes
had a strong tendency to get pursued by the villain across the galaxy and have
to invent their way out of their problem while they were being pursued. That
sort of action was the thing that suggested Spacewar. He had some very glowing
descriptions of spaceship encounters and space fleet maneuvers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Smith:</i></p>
<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote>
  &ldquo;The <i>Boise</i> leaped upon the Nevian, every weapon aflame. But, as
  Costigan had expected, Nerado&rsquo;s vessel was completely ready far any
  emergency. And, unlike her sister-ship, she was manned by scientists
  well-versed in the fundamental theory of the weapons with which they fought.
  Beams, rods and lances of energy flamed and flared; planes and pencils cut,
  slashed and stabbed; defensive screens glowed redly or flashed suddenly into
  intensely brilliant, coruscating incandescence. Crimson opacity struggled
  sullenly against violet curtains of annihilation. Material projectiles and
  torpedoes were launched under full-beam control; only to be exploded
  harmlessly in mid-space, to be blasted into nothingness or to disappear
  innocuously against impenetrable polycyclic screens.&rdquo;
  </blockquote>

<p>
Steve Russell: &ldquo;By picking a world which people weren&rsquo;t familiar
with, we could alter a number of parameters of the world in the interests of
making a good game and of making it possible to get it onto a computer. We made
a great deal of compromises from some of our original grand plans in order to
make it work well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One of the important things in Spacewar is the pace. It&rsquo;s
relatively fast-paced, and that makes it an interesting game. It seems to be a
reasonable compromise between action&mdash;pushing buttons&mdash;and thought.
Thought does help you, and there are some tactical considerations, but just
plain fast reflexes also help.
</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p>
&ldquo;It was quite interesting to fiddle with the parameters, which of course
I had to do to get it to be a really good game. By changing the parameters you
could change it anywhere from essentially just random, where it was pure luck,
to something where skill and experience counted above everything else. The
normal choice is somewhere between those two. With Spacewar an experienced
player can beat an amateur for maybe 20 to 50 games and then the amateur begins
to win a little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The pride of any hacker with a new program is its &ldquo;features.&rdquo; Fresh
forms of Spacewar with exotic new features proliferated. As Russell explains
it, everything at MIT had priority over Spacewar, but it was an educational
computer after all, and developing new programs (of Spacewar) was educational,
and then those programs needed testing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The initial game of
simply two spaceships and their torpedoes didn&rsquo;t last long.
</p>

<p>
Gravity was introduced. Then Peter Samson wrote in the starfield with a program
called &ldquo;Expensive Planetarium&rdquo; (MIT&rsquo;s first text display had
been called
&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expensive_Typewriter">Expensive Typewriter</a>&rdquo;).
Russell: &ldquo;Having a background was important to give some idea of range
and so on. Our Spacewar did not have gravity affecting the torpedoes&mdash;our
explanation was that they were photon bombs and that they weren&rsquo;t
affected by gravity. Subsequent versions on newer computers have got enough
compute time so that they can afford to use gravity for the torpedoes, and
that makes it a more interesting game.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then there came a startling development called Hyperspace&mdash;when your
situation got desperate you could push both turn buttons at once and go into
hyperspace: disappear from the screen for a few seconds and then reappear at a
random new position .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hyperspace was in within a month or so,&rdquo; says Russell.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little controversial. Some people deplore it, and
it&rsquo;s fairly common to play games without it. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was of
course vital to put in problems with hyperspace. You know, when you come back
into normal space from hyperspace, there is initially a small energy-well which
looks amazingly like a star; if a torpedo is shot into that energy well, lo and
behold the ship blows up. There is also a certain probability of blowing up as
you finally break out of hyperspace. Our explanation was that these were the
Mark One hyperfield generators and they hadn&rsquo;t done really a thorough job
of testing them&mdash;they had rushed them into the fleet. And unfortunately
the energies that were being dissipated in the generators at breakout were just
barely what they could handle. So the probability of the generator flying apart
and completely killing the spaceship was noticeable on the first couple of
uses, and after four uses it was only an even chance of surviving hyperspace.
So it was something that you could use but it wasn&rsquo;t something that you
wanted to use.&rdquo;

<p><i>&ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Smith:</i></p>

  <blockquote>
  &ldquo;Twenty-odd years before, when the then <i>Dauntless</i> and her crew
  were thrown out of a hyper-spatial tube and into that highly enigmatic Nth

  them, and put into the mind of Sir Austin Cardynge, mathematician
  extraordinary, the knowledge of how to find the way back to normal space.

<p class="intro">
<span class="runin"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_Peter_Deutsch">Peter Deutsch</a></span>,
now at Xerox Research Center, reminisces about the first Spacewar:
&ldquo;The programming of the thing was a remarkable tour de force, because the
machine did not have a multiply or divide. The way that the outline of the
spaceship was rotated was by compiling a special-purpose program. Nice
programming trick .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Spacewar was not an outgrowth of any work on
computer-graphics, but it may have inspired some of it. That&rsquo;s
speculation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Albert Kuhfeld, writing in July, 1971,
<a href="http://www.analogsf.com">Analog Magazine</a>, reminisces:
&ldquo;The first few years of Spacewar at MIT were the best. The game was in a
rough state, students were working their hearts out improving it, and the
faculty was nodding benignly as they watched the students learning computer
theory faster and more painlessly than they&rsquo;d ever seen before
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And a background of real-time interactive programming was being
built up that anybody in the school could draw on; one of the largest problems
in the development of the game was learning how to talk to a computer program
and have it answer back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Within weeks of its invention Spacewar was spreading across the country to
other computer research centers, who began adding their own wrinkles.
</p>

<p>
There was a variation called Minnesota Hyperspace in which you kept your
position but became invisible; however if you applied thrust, your
rocket flame could be seen. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Score-keeping. Space mines. Partial
damage&mdash;if hit in a fin you could not turn in that direction.
</p>

<p>
Then &ldquo;2&frac12;-D&rdquo; Spacewar, played on two consoles. Instead of
being God viewing the whole battle, you&rsquo;re a mere pilot with a view out
the front of your spaceship and the difficult task of <em>finding</em> your
enemy. (Perspective could be compressed so that even though far away the other
ship would be large enough to see.)
</p>

<p>
Adding incentive, MIT introduced an electric shock to go with the explosion of
your ship. A promising future is seen for sound effects. And now a few
commercial versions of Spacewar&mdash;25 cents a game&mdash;are appearing in
university coffee shops.
</p>

<p>
Steve Russell still dreams: &ldquo;Something which I wanted to do is get some
interesting sort of fleet action. There are some versions of Spacewar which
allow two, three ships, but as far as I know no one has been sufficiently
clever to set things up so there are ships with noticeably different
characteristics that could fight in interesting combinations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Lilly">John Lilly</a> (of
dolphin, acid, and bio-computer fame) tells a story that
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/us/en/">IBM</a> once forbade the playing of
Spacewar by IBM researchers. After a few suddenly uncreative months of
joyless research the ban was rescinded. Apparently, frivolous Spacewar had been
the medium of important experiments. (In every computer-business story
I&rsquo;ve ever heard, IBM invariably plays the heavy.)
</p>

<p>
Les Earnest at AI confirms the moral. For instance, at his lab the ingenious
device for handling interactive graphics on the time-shared computer is called
&ldquo;Spacewar Mode&rdquo; in honor of its origins.
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, there have been relatively few Spacewar-like games invented. The
most elaborate is a &ldquo;Snoopy and the Red Baron&rdquo; game which involves
flying your console like a biplane. But computer graphics as an area of
research has mushroomed. The field is too wide and deep and engrossing for me
to report here. It&rsquo;s an art form waiting for artists, a consciousness
form waiting for mystics.
</p>

<p>
All right, one sample: the vision helmet designed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland">Ivan Sutherland</a> at
<a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>. The helmet covers the front of
your face with special goggles that are tiny computer-driven TV screens. They
present you with a visual space in which you can move. The computer monitors
where your head moves and alters what you see accordingly. In the projected
reality you can look around, you can look behind you, you can move toward
things and through them. You can furthermore change parameters. Your head goes
forward a foot and in the vision you soar a hundred yards. Or you can travel in
exaggerated relativistic space, so that if you lunge at something it <em>bends
away</em>. Become a geometric point; become enormous; live out

<h2 id="arpa">ARPA</h2>

<p>
The letters stand for
<a href="http://www.darpa.mil/">Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>, one of
the rare success stories of Government action. Poetically enough it owes its
origin to real spacewar. After Russia&rsquo;s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik</a> humiliated the US
in the middle of the Fifties, America came back hard with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury">Mercury Program</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glenn">John Glenn</a> and all that,
crash-funded through a new agency directly under the Secretary of
Defense&mdash;ARPA.
</p>

<p>
When the US space program was moved out of the military to become
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA">NASA</a>, ARPA
was left with a lot of funding momentum and not much program. Into this vacuum
stepped J.C.R. Licklider among others, with the suggestion that since the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense">Defense Department</a>
was the world&rsquo;s largest user of computers, it would do well to support
large-scale basic research in computer science. It was ARPA&rsquo;s policy in
those days that basic research be neither secret nor limited to military
purposes, which boded well for exploration in an information-medium like
computers.
</p>

<p>
So in 1963 a fraction of ARPA&rsquo;s budget, some $5-8 million, went into a
program called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Processing_Techniques_Office">IPT</a>,
Information Processing Techniques, under the initial direction of Licklider and
then of a 26-year-old named Ivan Sutherland. Sutherland, the developer of
&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a>&rdquo;
at MIT, gave the agency its bias toward interactive graphics and its commitment
to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_skies_research">&ldquo;blue sky
mode&rdquo; research</a>. The next director,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)">Bob Taylor</a>,
then 32, doubled IPT&rsquo;s budget (while ARPA&rsquo;s overall budget was
shrinking) and administered a five-year golden age in computer research.
</p>

<p>
The beauty was, that being at the very top of the Defense Establishment, the
agency had little Congressional scrutiny and little bureaucratic
responsibility, able to take creative chances and protect long-term deep-goal
projects. Alan Kay: &ldquo;90 percent of all good things that I can think of
that have been done in computer science have been done funded by that agency.
Chances that they would have been funded elsewhere are very low. The basic ARPA
idea is that you find good people and you give them a lot of money and then you
step back. If they don&rsquo;t do good things in three years they get
dropped&mdash;where &lsquo;good&rsquo; is very much related to new or
interesting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Legends abound from early ARPA days, full of freedom and weirdness.
Here&rsquo;s one of many from
<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/mac/">Project MAC</a>
(Multiple Access Computer) days&mdash;Alan Kay: &ldquo;They had a thing on the
PDP-l called &lsquo;The Unknown Glitch&rsquo;
[&ldquo;<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/G/glitch.html">Glitch</a>&rdquo;&mdash;a
kink, a less-than-fatal but irritating fuck-up]. They used to program the thing
either in direct
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine code</a>,
direct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">octal</a>, or in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_debugging_technique">DDT</a>.
In the early days it was a paper-tape machine. It was painful to assemble
stuff, so they never listed out the programs. The programs and stuff just lived
in there, just raw seething octal code. And one of the guys wrote a program
called &lsquo;The Unknown Glitch,&rsquo; which at random intervals would wake
up, print out <b class="smallcaps">I Am The Unknown Glitch. Catch Me If You
Can</b>, and then it would relocate itself somewhere else in core memory, set a
clock interrupt, and go back to sleep. There was no way to find it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
One of the accomplishments of ARPA-funded research during this time was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing">time-sharing</a>.
Time-sharing is a routing technique that allows a large number of users to sit
down &ldquo;on-line&rdquo; with a computer as if each were all alone with it.
Naturally, timesharing was of no interest to computer manufacturers like IBM
since it meant drastically more efficient use of their hardware, and they were
still a long way from saturating their market with old technology. Only after
ARPA had developed time-sharing <em>and</em> its research-center market in the
mid-Sixties did the manufacturers adopt the innovation and make it available to
the rest of us. There&rsquo;s a political/economic moral in this story
somewhere; I think it has to do with the benefits of variant parallel systems.
</p>

<p>
ARPA is a rare but not completely isolated instance of enlightened government
research. For years the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Research">Office of Naval Research</a>
funded the most outstanding work in pure mathematics without any hope of
benefits for war-making.
</p>

<p>
In 1969 the political climate at ARPA changed with the passing into law of the
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/1970/mansfield.html">Mansfield Amendment</a>,
which required that military-funded research serve only clearly military goals
and answer to Congress on the matter. In other words, the Defense Department
was forbidden to try to obsolesce itself. Bob Taylor departed ARPA.
</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p>
The next (and current) director at ARPA-IPT was
<a href="http://packet.cc/">Larry Roberts</a>, a brilliant researcher who had
developed the first 3-D vision programs. His major project
has been getting the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPA Network</a> up.
(&ldquo;Up&rdquo; around computers means working, the opposite of
&ldquo;down&rdquo; or crashed.) The dream for the Net was that researchers at
widely separated facilities could share special resources, dip into each
other&rsquo;s files, and even work on-line together on design problems too
complex to solve alone.
</p>

<p>
At present some 20 major computer centers are linked on the two-year-old ARPA
Net. Traffic on the Net has been very slow, due to delays and difficulties of
translation between different computers and divergent projects. Use has
recently begun to increase as researchers travel from center to center and want
to keep in touch with home base, and as more tantalizing, sharable resources
come available. How Net usage will evolve is uncertain. There&rsquo;s a curious
mix of theoretical fascination and operational resistance around the scheme.
The resistance may have something to do with reluctances about equipping a
future Big Brother and his Central Computer. The fascination resides in the
thorough rightness of computers as communications instruments, which implies
some revolutions.
</p>

<p>
One popular new feature on the Net is AI&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.ap.org/">Associated Press</a> service. From anywhere on the
Net you can log in and get the news that&rsquo;s coming live over the wire or
ask for all the items on a particular subject that have come in during the last
24 hours. Plus a fortune cookie. Project that to household terminals, and so
much for newspapers (in present form).
</p>

<p>
Since huge quantities of information can be computer-digitalized and
transmitted, music researchers could, for example, swap records over the Net
with &ldquo;essentially perfect fidelity.&rdquo; So much for record stores (in
present form).
</p>

<p>
I asked Alan Kay if Spacewar had been played over the Net. He said it&rsquo;s
possible. I asked if there&rsquo;d been international Spacewar yet, and was told a
story. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a problem there of sending code groups. When
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Greenblatt_(programmer)">Greenblatt</a>&rsquo;s
chess program reigned supreme, they tried to play one of the Russian chess
programs. Instead of doing it by mail or using an international phone call they
decided to do it by amateur radio. There&rsquo;s this federal statute against
transmitting code groups of any kind, including chess moves. It took a long
time to straighten that out. There was eventual communication with the Russians
through a ham link in Switzerland.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
True hackers. Who won?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Greenblatt&rsquo;s program won. It&rsquo;s called
&lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Hack">MAC Hack</a> 6.&rsquo;
It was a Class C player, and has since been superseded by a couple of other
programs.&rdquo; Poor Russia. Do they regret Sputnik and the dialectical forces
it unleashed?

<p>
Xerox Research Center is an idyll, a new building high on an oak-savannahed
golden foothill in Stanford&rsquo;s industrial park in Palo Alto, California, a
blue-skied shimmery threatless landscape. &ldquo;Every time I think of that
place I start to scratch my balls. It makes me nervous,&rdquo; argues dome and
solar designer
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Baer">Steve Baer</a> from dusty
Albuquerque, recalling that most of the evil he knows has emitted from similar
ivory towers.
</p>

<p>
Alan Kay, 32, child prodigy (National Quiz Kid at ten), former musician and
artist, worked with Ivan Sutherland and Dave Evans at Utah, presently a
researcher at Xerox. Alan shifts comfortably in his office bean-bag chair and
appraises his colleagues. &ldquo;This is really a frightening group, by far the
best I know of as far as talent and creativity. The people here all have track
records and are used to dealing lightning with both hands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Peter Deutsch, bearded and intent, 26, veteran of the early days at Project
MAC, has served on every major front in computer science, now has a cubicle
near Kay&rsquo;s at Xerox Research Center. Alan remarks on his neighbor,
&ldquo;Peter is in my opinion the world&rsquo;s greatest programmer.
He&rsquo;s much more than a hacker, although he has some of that style.
He&rsquo;s a virtuoso; his programs have very few mistakes. He has probably
more written code running than anybody in the ARPA community.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Peter doesn&rsquo;t work for ARPA any more. One who does, Smokey, at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International">Stanford Research Institute</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_Research_Center">Augmentation Research Center</a>,
tells Peter, &ldquo;You get just a few more agates in that group and
you&rsquo;ll have <em>all</em> the marbles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="intro">
<span class="runin">The chief</span> marble collector is&mdash;well,
well&mdash;Bob Taylor. When he left the newly restricted ARPA he spent a year
at Utah decompressing from the Pentagon and then went to Xerox and there
continued his practice of finding and rewarding good men for doing pretty much
whatever they considered important work. Freedom to explore in the company of
talent is an irresistible lure. In two years Xerox had twenty of the best men
around working. Toward what? Well, whatever.
</p>

<p>
I ask Bob Taylor about his position at Xerox. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very
sharply defined. You could call me a research planner.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s Texas
born, trained in experimental psychology, soft-spoken. Where Alan Kay would
summarize one of Taylor&rsquo;s papers with the statement &ldquo;Economy of
scale is one of the biggest frauds ever invented,&rdquo; Taylor will respond to
a question about the economics of massive operations like huge computer
complexes with a long look, a puff of pipe smoke, and a remark that &ldquo;the
benefits are less than claimed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And that is the general bent of research at Xerox, soft, away from hugeness and
centrality, toward the small and the personal, toward putting maximum computer
power in the hands of every individual who wants it.
</p>

<p>
In one direction this means the automated office, replacing paper, desk and
phone with an interactive console&mdash;affording the possibility of doing the
whole of city work in a country cottage. The basic medium here is the text
manipulation system developed at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Doug Engelbart</a>&rsquo;s
Augmentation Research Center, which, as Doug puts it, allows you to
&ldquo;fly&rdquo; formerly unreachable breadths and depths of your information
matrix of your knowledge. Ask for item so-and-so from your file; <i>blink,</i>
there it is. Make some changes; it&rsquo;s changed. Designate keywords there
and there; done. Request a definition of that word; <i>blink</i>, presented.
Find a quote from a document in a friend&rsquo;s file; <i>blink, blink,
blink,</i> found. Behind that statement add a substatement giving
cross-references and cross-access; provided. Add a diagram and two photos;
sized and added. Send the entire document to the attention of these people;
sent. Plus one on paper to mail to Washington; <i>gzzaap,</i> hardcopy, with an
addressed envelope.
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s for grownups. Alan Kay is more interested in us kids. He
repudiates the manipulative arrogance of
&ldquo;Computer-Aided Instruction&rdquo; and serves the dictum of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert">Seymour Papert</a>,
&ldquo;Should the computer program the kid or should the kid program the
computer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Alan is designing a hand-held stand-alone interactive-graphic computer (about
the size, shape and diversity of a Whole Earth Catalog, electric) called
&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook">Dynabook</a>.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s mostly high-resolution display screen, with a keyboard on the
lower third and various cassette-loading slots, optional hook-up plugs, etc.
His colleague
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_English_(computer_engineer)">Bill English</a>
describes the fantasy thus:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It stores a couple of million characters of text and does all the text
handling for you&mdash;editing, viewing, scanning, things of that nature.
It&rsquo;ll have a graphics capability which&rsquo;ll let you make sketches,
make drawings. Alan wants to incorporate music in it so you can use it for
composing. It has the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> language
capability which lets people program their own things very easily. We want to
interface them with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinkertoy">tinker-toy</a> kind of thing.
And of course it plays Spacewar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The drawing capability is a program that Kay designed called
&ldquo;Paintbrush.&rdquo; Working with a stylus on the display screen, you
reach up and select a shape of brush, then move the brush over and pick up a
shade of half-tone-screen you like, then paint with it. If you make a mistake,
paint it out with &ldquo;white.&rdquo; The screen simultaneously displays the
image you&rsquo;re working on and a one-third reduction of it, where the dot
pattern becomes a shaded half-tone.
</p>

<p>
A Dynabook could link up with other Dynabooks, with library facilities, with
the telephone, and it could go and hide where a child hides. Alan is determined
to keep the cost below $500 so that school systems could provide Dynabooks free
out of their textbook budgets. If Xerox Corporation decides to go with the
concept and expand out of its office equipment rut, the Dynabooks could be
available in two or three years, but that&rsquo;s up to Product Development,
not Alan or the Research Center.
</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p>
Peter Deutsch comments: &ldquo;Processors and memories are getting smaller and
cheaper. Five years ago the idea of a Dynabook would have been absolutely
ridiculous. Now it merely seems difficult .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The emergence of
computers into society at large has come from a completely different quarter
than you&rsquo;d expect, namely the small calculating machine manufacturers.
The current ultimate step in that direction is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-35">Hewlett-Packard Pocket Calculator</a>.
They sell for $400, and they&rsquo;re essentially a small computer with no
program and very little storage.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Laboratories">Wang Laboratories</a>
makes calculators which are really computers in all but
name&mdash;they&rsquo;re programmable; they have lots of storage.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But still these things only reach thousands of people, not
millions. They&rsquo;ll reach millions when computer power becomes like
telephone power. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think it&rsquo;s important to bring
computing to the people.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2 id="counter-computer">
Counter-computer
</h2>

<p class="intro">
<span class="runin">How mass</span> use of computers might go is not even
slightly known as yet, except for obvious applications in the schools. One
informative place to inquire is among the hackers, particularly at night when
they&rsquo;re pursuing their own interests.
</p>

<p>
One night at a computer center (nameless) I wandered off from the Spacewar game
to a clattering printout machine where a (nameless) young man with a trim beard
was scanning columns of entries like, &ldquo;Pam $1.59, Bud $14.75, Annie
$2.66.&rdquo; He was an employee taking advantage of unbusy after hours time on
the computer (computers are never turned off) to run his commune accounts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Money seems to be a very sensitive issue,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;more sensitive than sex, even. People in the house who went on vacation
for a week didn&rsquo;t want to be charged for the food during that time and so
forth. It was taking me hours and hours every month to figure out
people&rsquo;s house bills. Now it takes about a half hour a month. Every week
I stick up a list on the refrigerator, and anyone who buys food or anything for
the house writes it down on the list. I type all that into the computer, along
with the mortgage payment and the phone bills and the gas bill. The House Bill
Program goes around and divides up the common charges and adds in all the
special charges and figures out exactly who owes who how much. Each person at
the end of the month gets a bill plus a complete breakdown of what their money
goes to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s pretty good. What else goes on around here in moonlight mode?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A friend of mine has his recording tape library index on the computer.
Everyone does their term papers and their theses on it. It&rsquo;ll justify
margins, incorporate corrections, handle illustrations, paging, footnotes,
headings, indexing. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two years ago when we had the great faculty
strike against the War, we rigged up a program that would type out a form
letter to all your congressmen and type in your name and address.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bruce is working on an astrology program. You put in your birthplace and
date, down to the minute, and it gives you all your aspects, your chart. You
can get your progress chart too .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One of the hackers is building
a computer at home out of Army surplus parts, and he&rsquo;s using the
facilities here to help his design, because we have this huge battery of
computer design programs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Indeed. Far beyond borrowing some one else&rsquo;s computer is having your
<em>own</em> computer. Hear now the saga of Pam Hart and Resource One. In 1969
Pam was a computer programmer at
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/index.html">Berkeley</a> who found the work
&ldquo;just too disillusioning. Then during the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_Campaign">Cambodia Invasion</a>
demonstrations in Berkeley a group of us got together and designed a retrieval
program for coordinating all of the actions on campus. It was a fairly dead
system, but what it did was it brought together people who had never worked
together before and started them talking and thinking about how it was actually
possible to do something positive with technology, when <em>you</em> define the
goals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Computing power to the people. So began one of the great hustles of modern
times. Peter Deutsch is still awed: &ldquo;Pam could hustle blood from a
turnip.&rdquo; She speaks quietly in a hasty, gentle, self-effacing murmur. You
have to lean close to hear the lady helping you help her to plant dynamite in
the very heart of the Combine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Four of us came from Berkeley to Project One and set up in a little
office on the second floor. [Project One is a factory warehouse in the
south-of-Market area of San Francisco. It started in 1970 with a radio
announcement: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re interested in building a community and
cheap space and sharing resources, come to Project One.&rdquo; Within two weeks
the building was filled with 200 artists, craftsmen, technicians and
ex-professionals, and their families.] We worked on designing a retrieval
system so all the switchboards in the City could interact, using a common data
base, with all the care taken for privacy and knowing who put stuff in so you
could refer back. Hopefully you could generate lists that were updated and be
as on-line as possible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We found that it just did not work using borrowed time, stolen time,
bought time&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t afford it. So about a year later we set
about getting surplus. After a couple of months of calling everybody in San
Francisco that was related to computers,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transamerica_Corporation">Trans-america</a>
said that they had three
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDS_940">XDS 940</a>s in a warehouse
[each costing $300,000 new]
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We negotiated the contract, got a 940 [free], which we refurbished. It
arrived last April; we installed it in June. It was probably the fastest
machine installation ever: We had it up in three days. We were really fortunate
the whole time. We had a lot of people from Xerox Park, a lot of the old people
from Berkeley Computer Corporation, that have assisted us in areas where we
weren&rsquo;t totally sure of the appropriate thing to do ourselves. Peter
Deutsch brought up the operating system.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re a little more stable economically. We got a foundation
grant of $10,000 last November from Stern. Then we borrowed $8000 from the
Whole Earth Catalog, of which we paid back six. [News to me. This was part of
the $20,000 I had turned over to the mob at the Catalog Demise Party. One
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Moore_(activist)">Fred Moore</a>
finally signed for $15,000 of it and ran a series of subsequent consensus money
decidings, which evidently were susceptible to Pam&rsquo;s soft voice and clear
head.] After two years we&rsquo;re right there at the beginning point of
actually being able to do the things that we said we wanted to do.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One of the first things we have to do is have a retrieval system
that&rsquo;s general enough that it can handle things like Switchboard referral
information, also people who are doing investigative work on corporations,
people doing research on foundations, a whole lot of different groups either
willing or not willing to share data bases.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re interested in some health care statistical systems. There
are a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_clinic">Free
Clinics</a> in the city, and they have to do all of their work by hand. We want
to incorporate a system doing statistical work for the clinics, charging the
Health Centers that have money and not charging the Free Clinics that
don&rsquo;t have money.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A third area is using government generated tapes like assessor&rsquo;s
tapes and census tapes, and start trying to do some analysis of the city. And
the education program. The ideas include what
<a href="https://openlibrary.org/publishers/Dymax">Dymax</a> is doing&mdash;set
up a little recreation center where people could come and play games and
hopefully some of them would be learning games. And then I&rsquo;m interested
in doing community education with video tape. People want to know about
computers, not how to use them, necessarily, but how they&rsquo;re used against
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Counter-computer. At present there are ten people in the core group at Resource
One ranging in age from 19 to 30 (Pam is 25), with decisions made by consensus.
</p>

<p>
Another scheme in the works involves the people around
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Beck_(director)">Steve Beck</a> at
the <a href="http://ncet.torusgallery.com/intro.html">National Center for
Experiments in Television</a> a few blocks away. Steve has built the
world&rsquo;s first real-time video synthesizer&mdash;the video equivalent of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moog_synthesizer">Moogs</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchla_Electronic_Musical_Instruments">Buchlas</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_Instruments">Arps</a> of music
synthesis. It&rsquo;s a natural to link up with a computer. The current plan is
for Steve and his equipment to move into the basement below Resource One, which
should liven up the scene&mdash;Pam&rsquo;s gang is short on true hacker
time-wasting frivolity; they&rsquo;re warm, but rather stodgier than some of
the Government-funded folks. Maybe the video link-up will give us some higher
levels of Spacewar on the way to exploring new territory entirely. In what
directions the computer-use at Resource One evolves should be of interest. If I
were a computer manufacturer I&rsquo;d pay the closest attention and maybe
donate some goodies.

Control and Spontaneity
</h2>

<p class="intro">
<span class="runin">I&rsquo;m no</span> manufacturer, but I&rsquo;m a hungry
enough potential user to pretend briefly that I know what I&rsquo;m talking
about and run a trial polemic .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
Until computers come to the people we will have no real idea of their most
natural functions. Up to the present their cost and size has kept them in the
province of rich and powerful institutions, who, understandably, have developed
them primarily as bookkeeping, sorting and control devices. The computers have
been a priceless aid in keeping the lid on top-down organization. They are
splendidly impressive as oracles of (programmable) Truth, the lofty voice of
unchangeable authority.
</p>

<p>
In fact, computers don&rsquo;t know shit. Their special talent in the direction
of intelligence is the ability to make elabrate models and fiddle with them, to
answer in detail questions that begin &ldquo;What if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; In
this they parallel (and can help) the acquiring of intelligence by children.
But the basic fact of computer use is &ldquo;<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">Garbage In, Garbage
Out</a>&rdquo;&mdash;if you feed the computer nonsense, it will dutifully
convert your mistake into insanity-cubed and feed it back to you. Children are
different&mdash;&ldquo;Garbage In, Food Out&rdquo; is common with them. Again,
the benefits of variant parallel systems. Computer function is mostly
one-track-mind, in which inconsistency is intolerable. The human mind functions
on multiple tracks (not all of them accessible); it can tolerate and even
thrive on inconsistency.
</p>

<p>
I suggest that the parallel holds for the overall picture of computer use.
Where a few brilliantly stupid computers can wreak havoc, a host of modest
computers (and some brilliant ones) serving innumerable individual purposes can
be healthful, can repair havoc, feed life. (Likewise, 20 crummy speakers at
once will give better sound fidelity than one excellent speaker&mdash;try it.)
</p>

<p>
Spacewar serves Earthpeace. So does any funky playing with computers or any
computer-pursuit of your own peculiar goals, and especially any use of
computers to offset other computers. It won&rsquo;t be so hard. The price of
hardware is coming down fast, and with the new
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS">CMOS</a> chips (Complimentary
Metal Oxide Semiconductor integrated circuits) the energy-drain of major
computing drops to flashlight-battery level.
</p>

<p>
Part of the grotesqueness of American life in these latter days is a
subservience to Plan that amounts to panic. What we don&rsquo;t intend
<em>shouldn&rsquo;t happen</em>. What happens anyway is either blamed on our
enemies or baldly ignored. In our arrogance we close our ears to voices not our
rational own, we reject the princely gifts of spontaneous generation.
</p>

<p>
Spacewar as a parable is almost too pat. It was the illegitimate child of the
marrying of computers and graphic displays. It was part of no one&rsquo;s grand
scheme. It served no grand theory. It was the enthusiasm of irresponsible
youngsters. It was disreputably competitive. (&ldquo;You killed me,
Tovar!&rdquo;) It was an administrative headache. It was merely delightful.
</p>

<p>
Yet Spacewar, if anyone cared to notice, was a flawless crystal ball of things
to come in computer science and computer use:
</p>

<ol>
<li>It was intensely interactive in real time with the computer.</li>
<li>It encouraged new programming by the user.</li>
<li>It bonded human and machine through a responsive broadband interface of
  live graphics display.</li>
<li>It served primarily as a communication device between humans.</li>
<li>It was a game.</li>
<li>It functioned best on stand-alone equipment (and disrupted multiple-user
  equipment).</li>
<li>It served human interest, not machine. (Spacewar is trivial to a
  computer.)</li>
<li>It <em>was</em> delightful.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In those days of batch processing and passive consumerism (data was something
you sent to the manufacturer, like color film), Spacewar was heresy, uninvited
and unwelcome.
</p>

<p>The hackers made Spacewar, not the planners.</p>

<p>
When computers become available to everybody, the hackers take over: We are all
Computer Bums, all more empowered as individuals and as co-operators. That
might enhance things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like the richness and rigor of spontaneous
creation and of human interaction .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of sentient interaction.

<p>
As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Moorer">Andy Moorer</a> puts
it, &ldquo;Basically all you have to do is read a book on computer programming,
and you&rsquo;re an instant computer scientist.&rdquo; Alan Kay insists that most of
computer science can be mastered in one year of close attention. That&rsquo;s how
young a science it is.
</p>

<p>
The main thing is getting with computers. If you live near a university or have
family in a business that uses computers, you may be able to wangle moonlight
time and informal instruction.
</p>

<p>
If you&rsquo;re in school (college, high school, grade or Free) it shouldn&rsquo;t be too
hard to con them into buying some decent equipment&mdash;tell them they can use it
for school accounts at night. According to
<a href="http://iae-pedia.org/Robert_Albrecht">Bob Albrecht</a> of Dymax
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Computer_Company">People&rsquo;s Computer Company</a>),
the best school computers are from DEC and H-P: &ldquo;Both of these companies
have made a real commitment. They have qualified educational staff,
they&rsquo;re developing new stuff, they&rsquo;ve got credibility.&rdquo;

DEC has what they call Edu Systems, three families of computers ranging from a
single-terminal PDP-8 ($7K [$7000]; can handle up to 16 terminals) to the big
PDP-10 ($500K). And H-P has their 2000-series, ranging from the 2000E ($50K) to
the 2000C ($300K).
</p>

<p>
Some school systems are starting miniature ARPA Nets. Bob Albrecht reports,
&ldquo;Minnesota may become the first state to have a statewide network where every
kid will have access to a computer. There are more than 200 schools already
tied into the network. And Long Island has a consortium with 40 schools on a
PDP-10.&rdquo;

If you&rsquo;re looking for good computer science in a college, the best is
Carnegie-Mellon at Pittsburgh, then Stanford and MIT, with Utah, Cal Tech and
Illinois following. The college that exposes more of its students to computer
use than anyone is Dartmouth.

<h2 id="your-own-spacewar">Your Own Spacewar</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>
Though no one has done it yet, Alan Kay is convinced a modest Spacewar could be
built cheap: &ldquo;You can do motion with a couple of integrators.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit">Heathkit</a> has this
l6-integrator analogue computer you can build as a kit for 700 bucks or
something like that. You have to have two layers of integrators to get an
inverse-square law, so you should be able to get gravity and orbits with that
one. To make spaceship outlines and explosion patterns you need a few bits of
digital memory. Two chips worth of register file should do it. I think
electronics stores may carry the chips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The controls for Spacewar are trivial. The simplest way is to go to a
radio control store&mdash;like for model airplanes&mdash;and get the front end
of the radio controller, which has two sets of joysticks and the pots and
everything else. You can use those as the inputs to the analogue computer. They
only cost something like thirty bucks.&rdquo; Once you have the computer, your
own or someone else&rsquo;s, you can write your own Spacewar program or start
with this one of Kay&rsquo;s:
