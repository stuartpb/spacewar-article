<p class="intro">
<span class="runin">Ready or</span> not, computers are coming to the people.
</p>

<p>
That's good news, maybe the best since psychedelics. It's way off the track of
the "Computers&mdash;Threat or menace?" school of liberal criticism but
surprisingly in line with the romantic fantasies of the forefathers of the
science such as Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, J.C.R. Licklider, John von
Neumann and Vannevar Bush.
</p>

<p>
The trend owes its health to an odd array of influences: The youthful fervor
and firm dis-Establishmentarianism of the freaks who design computer science;
an astonishingly enlightened research program from the very top of the Defense
Department; an unexpected market-flanking movement by the manufacturers of
small calculating machines, and an irrepressible midnight phenomenon known as
Spacewar.
</p>

<p>
Reliably, at any nighttime moment (i.e. non-business hours) in North America
hundreds of computer technicians are effectively out of their bodies, locked in
life-or-death space combat computer-projected onto cathode ray tube display
screens, for hours at a time, ruining their eyes, numbing their fingers in
frenzied mashing of control buttons, joyously slaying their friend and wasting
their employers' valuable computer time. Something basic is going on.
</p>

<p>
Rudimentary Spacewar consists of two humans, two sets of control buttons or
joysticks, one TV-like display and one computer. Two spaceships are displayed
in motion on the screen, controllable for thrust, yaw, pitch and the firing of
torpedoes. Whenever a spaceship and torpedo meet, they disappear in an
attractive explosion. That's the original version invented in 1962 at MIT by
Steve Russell. (More on him in a moment.)
</p>

<p>
October, 1972, 8 PM, at <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/">Stanford's Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Laboratory</a>, moonlit and remote in the foothills above
Palo Alto, California. Two dozen of us are jammed in a semi-dark console room
just off the main hall containing AI's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10">PDP&#8209;10</a> computer. AI's Head
System Programmer and most avid Spacewar nut,
<!-- sic: Ralph Gorin's name is misspelled in the source material -->
Ralph Goring, faces a display screen which says only:
</p>

<p class="conout"><code>This Console Available.</code></p>

<p>
He logs in on the keyboard with his initials: Click clickclickclick click.
</p>

<p class="conout"><code>
L1,Reg<br>
CSD Fall Picnic. Saturday 11 AM in Flood Park .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</code></p>

<p>
He interrupts further announcements, including one about the "First
Intergalactic Spacewar Olympics" at 8 PM, with: Click ("run")
clickclickclick ("Space War Ralph") click ("do it").
</p>

<p class="conout"><code>R SWR.<br>
Welcome to spacewar.<br>
How many ships? Maximum is 5.
</code></p>

<p>
Click: 5 (Five players. This is for the first familiarization
battles in the Spacewar Olympics, initiated by me and sponsored (beer &amp;
prizes) by <cite class="smallcaps">Rolling Stone</cite>. Friends, I won't be
able to explain every computer-technical term that comes by. Fortunately you
don't need them to get the gist of what's happening.)
</p>

<p class="conout">
<code>Keyboard buttons? (Else regular). Type Y or N.</code>
</p>

<p>"Yes." Click: Y</p>

<p class="conout">
<code>
The standard game is:<br>
1 console, 2 torpedo tubes, (normal) scoring, no partial damage, no hyperspace,
killer sun. Ships start in standard positions. Type Y to get a standard game.
</code>
</p>

<p>Ralph wants other features. "No." Click: N</p>

<p class="conout">
<code>
How many space mines do you want?<br>
Choose from zero to 4.
</code>
</p>

<p>Click: 4</p>
<p class="conout"><code>Partial damage?</code></p>
<p>Click: N</p>
<p class="conout"><code>Display scores?</code></p>
<p>Click: Y</p>
<p class="conout"><code>Two torpedo tubes?</code></p>
<p>Click: N</p>
<p class="conout"><code>Random starting positions?</code></p>
<p>Click: Y</p>

<p>
Immediately the screen goes dark and then displays: Five different spaceships,
each with a dot indicating torpedo tubes are loaded, five scores, each at zero,
a convincing starfield, and four space mines orbiting around a central sun,
toward which the spaceships are starting to fall at a correctly accelerating
rate.
</p>

<p>
Players seize the five sets of control buttons, find their spaceship persona on
the screen, and simultaneously turn and fire toward any nearby still-helpless
spaceships, hit the thrust button to initiate orbit before being slurped by the
killer sun, and evade or shoot down any incoming enemy torpedoes or orbiting
mines. After two torpedoes are fired, each ship has a three second unarmed
"reloading" time. Fired torpedoes last nine seconds and then disappear.
</p>

<p>
As kills are made the scores start to change. +1 for a successful kill,
<!-- Note: the minus in "-1" is missing in the archive scan I'm looking at. -->
-1 for being killed, +1 for being lone survivor of a battle. Personalities
begin to establish themselves in the maneuvering spaceships: The pilot of the
ship called <i>Pointy Fins</i> is a dead shot but panics easily in cross fire.
<i>Roundback</i> tries to avoid early dueling and routinely fires two torpedoes
"around the universe" (off the screen, so they reappear lethally unexpected
from the opposite side). <i>Birdie</i> drives for the sun and a fast orbit,
has excellent agility in sensing and facing toward hazard. <i>Funny Fins</i>
shouts a lot, singling out individual opponents. <i>Flatback</i> is silent and
maintains an uncanny field-sense of the whole battlesky, impervious to surprise
attack.
</p>

<p>
A game is over when only one or no survivors are displayed. The screen then
blanks out, counts down 5-4-3-2-1,  and redisplays a new battle with ships at
new random positions equidistant from the sun and showing scores accumulative
from previous games. A spaceship that is killed early in a battle will
reincarnate after 16 seconds and rejoin the fray, so that a single battle may
last up to five minutes with a weak player perishing several times in it.
</p>

<p>
The twenty or so raucous competitors in the Spacewar Olympics quickly organize
three events: Five-Player Free-For-All, Team Competition (two against two), and
Singles Competition. The executive officer of the AI Project,
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~learnest/">Les Earnest</a>, who kindly OKed
these Olympics and their visibility, is found to have no immediate function and
is sent out for beer.
</p>

<p>
The setting and decor at AI is Modern Mad Scientist&mdash;long hallways and
cubicles and large windowless rooms, brutal fluorescent light, enormous
machines humming and clattering, robots on wheels, scurrying arcane
technicians. And, also, posters and announcements against the Vietnam War and
Richard Nixon, computer print-out photos of girlfriends, a hallway-long banner
<b class="smallcaps">Solving Today's Problems Tomorrow</b>, and signs on every
door in Tolkien's elvish Feanorian script&mdash;the director's office is
Imladris, the coffee room The Prancing Pony, the computer room Mordor. There's
a lot of hair on those technicians, and nobody seems to be telling them where
to scurry.
</p>

<p>
The games progress. A tape recorder kibitzes on the first round of Team
Competition, four ships twisting, converging, evading, exploding:
</p>

<p><i>Where am I? Where am I?</i> Click clickclickclickclick</p>
<p><i>Agh!</i> Clickclickclick clickclick</p>
<p><i>Glitch.</i> Clickclick</p>
<p><i>OK, I won't shoot.</i> Clickclickclick</p>
<p><i>Good work Tovar. Revenge.</i> Clickclick clickclick</p>
<p><i>Cease fire.</i> Click clickclick.</p>
<p><i>Ohhhhhh NO! You killed me, Tovar.</i></p>
<p><i>I'm sorry.</i> Clickclickclick</p>
<p><i>Being partners means never having to say you're sorry.</i>
  Clickclickclick </p>
<p><i>Get him! Get the mother!</i> Clickclickclickclickclick</p>
<p><i>Sacrifice.</i> Clickclick click</p>
<p><i>Lemme get in orbit.</i> Clickclick</p>
<p><i>Way to dodge.</i> Click clickclickclick</p>
<p><i>Awshit.</i></p>
<p><i>Get tough now.</i> Clickclickclick</p>
<p><i>The other guy was out of torps. I knew it and waited till I got a good
  shot.</i> Clickclick</p>
<p><i>A beaut. O lord.</i> Clickclickclick</p>
<p><i>I shot him but then I slurped.</i> Clickclick clickclick</p>
<p><i>Oooo!</i></p>
<p><i>We win! Tovar and Rem!</i></p>

<p>
Correct. Tovar and Rem won the Team Competition (REM is how Robert E. Maas is
known to the computer and thence to his friends).
<a href="http://www.baumgart.org/">Bruce Baumgart</a>, who by day builds
sensing intelligence into a robot vehicle, won the Free-For-All with a
powerhouse performance. And slim Tovar took the Singles.

<p>
Meanwhile, your photographer Annie, was tugged all over the lab to see the
hand-eye rig, the number half-tone printer, various spectacular
geometric display hacks, computer music programs, the color video image maker
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Four intense hours, much frenzy and skilled concerted action, a
15-ring circus in ten different directions, the most bzz-bzz-busy scene I've
been around since Merry Prankster Acid Tests .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and really it's
just a normal night at the AI Project, at any suitably hairy computer research
project. Something basic .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
These are heads, most of them. Half or more of computer science is heads. But
that's not it. The rest of the counterculture is laid low and back these days,
showing none of this kind of zeal. What, then?
</p>

<h2>
The Hackers
</h2>

<p>
I'm guessing that Alan Kay at Xerox Research Center (more on them shortly) has
a line on it, defining the standard Computer Bum:
</p>

<p>
"About as straight as you'd expect hotrodders to look. It's that kind of
fanaticism. A true hacker is not a group person. He's a person who loves to
stay up all night, he and the machine in a love-hate relationship
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They're kids who tended to be brilliant but not very interested
in conventional goals. And computing is just a fabulous place for that, because
it's a place where you don't have to be a Ph.D. or anything else. It's a place
where you can still be an artisan. People are willing to pay you if you're any
good at all, and you have plenty of time for screwing around."
</p>

<p>
The hackers are the technicians of this science&mdash;"It's a term of derision and
also the ultimate compliment." They are the ones who translate human demands
into code that the machines can understand and act on. They are legion.
Fanatics with a potent new toy. A mobile new-found elite, with its own apparat,
language and character, its own legends and humor. Those magnificent men with
their flying machines, scouting a leading edge of technology which has an odd
softness to it; outlaw country, where rules are not decree or routine so much
as the starker demands of what's possible.
</p>

<p>
A young science travels where the young take it. The wiser computer research
directors have learned that <em>not</em> trusting their young programmers with
major responsibility can lead immediately to no research. AI is one of perhaps
several dozen computer research centers that are flourishing with their young,
some of them with no more formal education than they got at the local Free
School. I'm talking to Les Earnest, the gent who went for beer. He's tall,
swarthy, has a black and white striped beard, looks like a Sufi athlete. He's
telling me about what else people build here besides refinements of Spacewar.
There's a speech recognition project. There's the hand-eye project, in which
the computer is learning to see and visually correct its robot functions.
There's work on symbolic computation and grammatical inference. Work with
autistic children, "trying to get them to relate to computers first, and then
later to people. This seems to be successful in part because many of these
children think of themselves as machines. You can encourage them to interact in
a game with the machine."
</p>

<p>
Another window on the interests of AI and of the hackers is a posted printout
of the file of AI's system programs, some 250 elaborate routines available.
Scanning: <i>Hand Eye Monitor</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Go Game</i>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>DPY Hack Broom Balancing</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Comparison

.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Tell Everyone the System Is Going Down</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<i>Music Compiler Sort Of</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>New Music Compiler</i>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
A distinction exists between low-rent and high-rent computer research, between
preoccupations of support group (hackers) and of research group. The
distinction blurs often. Les Earnest: "Sometimes it's hard to tell the
difference between recreation and work, happily. We try to judge people not on
how much time they waste but on what they accomplish over fairly long periods
of time, like a half year to a year." He adds that Spacewar players "are more
from the support groups than the research groups. The research groups tend to
get their kicks out of research.
</p>

<p>Spacewar is low-rent.</p>

<h2>
Spacewar
</h2>

<p>
Low-rent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but pervasive. Alan Kay: "The game of Spacewar
blossoms spontaneously wherever there is a graphics display connected to a
computer."
</p>

<p>
The first opportunity was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Electrical Engineering Department back in 1961-1962. The earliest
mini-computer, Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-1, was installed in the
kludge room with a cathode ray tube display hooked on. ("Kludge"&mdash;any
lash-up often involving chewing gum, paper clips, scotch tape; it works if no
one trips over a wire; unadaptable; a working mess.) There it was that Steve
Russell and his fellow hackers Alan Kotok, Peter Samson and Dan Edwards
introduced Spacewar to the world.
</p>

<p>
I phoned Russell at the sprawling old fabric mill in Maynard, Massachusetts,
where Digital Equipment Corporation manufactures the most popular research and
education computers on the market. Russell currently is a researcher for them
working on man-machine interface problems&mdash;adapting computer nature to fit
human nature. Back in 1962 he was a hacker, 23 or so, a math major two years
out of Dartmouth working in the brand new field of computer science for John
McCarthy at MIT.
</p>

<p>
His account of the invention of Spacewar is not only intriguing history, it's
the most sophisticated analysis of good game design I've ever run across -
elegant work. But that's in retrospect; back then it was just kids staying up
all night.
</p>

<p>
"We had this brand new PDP-l," Steve Russell recalls. "It was the first
mini-computer, ridiculously inexpensive for its time. And it was just sitting
there. It had a console typewriter that worked right, which was rare, and a
paper tape reader and a cathode ray tube display. [There had been CRT displays
before, but primarily in the Air Defense System.] Somebody had built some
little pattern-generating programs which made interesting patterns like a
kaleidoscope. Not a very good demonstration. Here was this display that could
do all sorts of good things! So we started talking about it, figuring what
would be interesting displays. We decided that probably you could make a
two-dimensional maneuvering sort of thing, and decided that naturally the
obvious thing to do was spaceships."
</p>

<p>
Naturally?
</p>

<p>
"I had just finished reading
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Smith">'Doc' Smith</a>'s
<cite>Lensman</cite> series. He was some sort of scientist but he wrote this
really dashing brand of science fiction. The details were very good and it had
an excellent pace. His heroes had a strong tendency to get pursued by the
villain across the galaxy and have to invent their way out of their problem
while they were being pursued. That sort of action was the thing that suggested
Spacewar. He had some very glowing descriptions of spaceship encounters and
space fleet maneuvers."
</p>

<p><i>"Doc" Smith:</i></p>
<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote>
  "The <i>Boise</i> leaped upon the Nevian, every weapon aflame. But, as
  Costigan had expected, Nerado's vessel was completely ready far any
  emergency. And, unlike her sister-ship, she was manned by scientists
  well-versed in the fundamental theory of the weapons with which they fought.
  Beams, rods and lances of energy flamed and flared; planes and pencils cut,
  slashed and stabbed; defensive screens glowed redly or flashed suddenly into
  intensely brilliant, coruscating incandescence. Crimson opacity struggled
  sullenly  against violet curtains of annihilation. Material projectiles and
  torpedoes were launched under full-beam control; only to be exploded
  harmlessly in mid-space, to be blasted into nothingness or to disappear
  innocuously against impenetrable polycyclic screens."

</figure>

<p>
Steve Russell: "By picking a world which people weren't familiar with, we could
alter a number of parameters of the world in the interests of making a good
game and of making it possible to get it onto a computer. We made a great deal
of compromises from some of our original grand plans in order to make it work
well.
</p>

<p>
"One of the important things in Spacewar is the pace. It's relatively
fast-paced, and that makes it an interesting game. It seems to be a reasonable
compromise between action&mdash;pushing buttons&mdash;and thought. Thought does help
you, and there are some tactical considerations, but just plain fast reflexes
also help.
</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p>
"It was quite interesting to fiddle with the parameters, which of course I had
to do to get it to be a really good game. By changing the parameters you could
change it anywhere from essentially just random, where it was pure luck, to
something where skill and experience counted above everything else. The normal
choice is somewhere between those two. With Spacewar an experienced player can
beat an amateur for maybe 20 to 50 games and then the amateur begins to win a
little."
</p>

<p>
The pride of any hacker with a new program is its "features." Fresh forms of
Spacewar with exotic new features proliferated. As Russell explains it,
everything at MIT had priority over Spacewar, but it was an educational
computer after all, and developing new programs (of Spacewar) was educational,
and then those programs needed testing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The initial game of
simply two spaceships and their torpedoes didn't last long.
</p>

<p>
Gravity was introduced. Then Peter Samson wrote in the starfield with a program
called "Expensive Planetarium" (MIT's first text display had been called
"Expensive Typewriter"). Russell: "Having a background was important to give
some idea of range and so on. Our Spacewar did not have gravity affecting the
torpedoes&mdash;our explanation was that they were photon bombs and that they
weren't affected by gravity. Subsequent versions on newer computers have got
enough compute time so that they can afford to use gravity for the torpedoes,
and that makes it a more interesting game."
</p>

<p>
And then there came a startling development called Hyperspace&mdash;when your
situation got desperate you could push both turn buttons at once and go into
hyperspace: disappear from the screen for a few seconds and then reappear at a
random new position .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe.
</p>

<p>
"Hyperspace was in within a month or so," says Russell. "It's a little
controversial. Some people deplore it, and it's fairly common to play games
without it. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was of course vital to put in problems with
hyperspace. You know, when you come back into normal space from hyperspace,
there is initially a small energy-well which looks amazingly like a star; if a
torpedo is shot into that energy well, lo and behold the ship blows up. There
is also a certain probability of blowing up as you finally break out of
hyperspace. Our explanation was that these were the Mark One hyperfield
generators and they hadn't done really a thorough job of testing them&mdash;they
had rushed them into the fleet. And unfortunately the energies that were being
dissipated in the generators at breakout were just barely what they could
handle. So the probability of the generator flying apart and completely killing
the spaceship was noticeable on the first couple of uses, and after four uses
it was only an even chance of surviving hyperspace. So it was something that
you could use but it wasn't something that you wanted to use."

  "Twenty-odd years before, when the then <i>Dauntless</i> and her crew were

  put into the mind of Sir Austin Cardynge, mathematician extraordinary, the
  knowledge of how to find the way back to normal space. Thorndyke, working

<p class="intro">
<span class="runin">Peter Deutsch</span>, now at Xerox Research Center,
reminisces about the first Spacewar: "The programming of the thing was a
remarkable tour de force, because the machine did not have a multiply or
divide. The way that the outline of the spaceship was rotated was by compiling
a special-purpose program. Nice programming trick .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Spacewar was
not an outgrowth of any work on computer-graphics, but it may have inspired
some of it. That's speculation."
</p>

<p>
Albert Kuhfeld, writing in July, 1971, Analog Magazine, reminisces: "The first
few years of Spacewar at MIT were the best. The game was in a rough state,
students were working their hearts out improving it, and the faculty was
nodding benignly as they watched the students learning computer theory faster
and more painlessly than they'd ever seen before .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And a
background of real-time interactive programming was being built up that anybody
in the school could draw on; one of the largest problems in the development of
the game was learning how to talk to a computer program and have it answer
back."
</p>

<p>
Within weeks of its invention Spacewar was spreading across the country to
other computer research centers, who began adding their own wrinkles.
</p>

<p>
There was a variation called Minnesota Hyperspace in which you kept your
position but became invisible; however if you applied thrust, your
rocket flame could be seen. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Score-keeping. Space mines. Partial
damage&mdash;if hit in a fin you could not turn in that direction.
</p>

<p>
Then "2&frac12;-D" Spacewar, played on two consoles. Instead of being God
viewing the whole battle, you're a mere pilot with a view out the front of your
spaceship and the difficult task of <em>finding</em> your enemy. (Perspective
could be compressed so that even though far away the other ship would be large
enough to see.)
</p>

<p>
Adding incentive, MIT introduced an electric shock to go with the explosion of
your ship. A promising future is seen for sound effects. And now a few
commercial versions of Spacewar&mdash;25 cents a game&mdash;are appearing in university
coffee shops.
</p>

<p>
Steve Russell still dreams: "Something which I wanted to do is get some
interesting sort of fleet action. There are some versions of Spacewar which
allow two, three ships, but as far as I know no one has been sufficiently
clever to set things up so there are ships with noticeably different
characteristics that could fight in interesting combinations."
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Lilly"></a>John Lilly</a> (of
dolphin, acid, and bio-computer fame) tells a story that IBM once forbade the
playing of Spacewar by IBM researchers. After a few suddenly uncreative months
of joyless research the ban was rescinded. Apparently, frivolous Spacewar had
been the medium of important experiments. (In every computer-business story
I've ever heard, IBM invariably plays the heavy.)
</p>

<p>
Les Earnest at AI confirms the moral. For instance, at his lab the ingenious
device for handling interactive graphics on the time-shared computer is called
"Spacewar Mode" in honor of its origins.
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, there have been relatively few Spacewar-like games invented. The
most elaborate is a "Snoopy and the Red Baron" game which involves flying your
console like a biplane. But computer graphics as an area of research has
mushroomed. The field is too wide and deep and engrossing for me to report
here. It's an art form waiting for artists, a consciousness form waiting for
mystics.
</p>

<p>
All right, one sample: the vision helmet designed by Ivan Sutherland at
Harvard. The helmet covers the front of your face with special goggles that are
tiny computer-driven TV screens. They present you with a visual space in which
you can move.  The computer monitors where your head moves and alters what you
see accordingly. In the projected reality you can look around, you can look
behind you, you can move toward things and through them. You can furthermore
change parameters. Your head goes forward a foot and in the vision you soar a
hundred yards. Or you can travel in exaggerated relativistic space, so that if
you lunge at something it <em>bends away</em>. Become a geometric point; become
enormous; live out Olaf Stapledon's

</p>

<h2>ARPA</h2>

<p>
The letters stand for Advanced Research Projects Agency, one of the rare
success stories of Government action. Poetically enough it owes its origin to
real spacewar. After Russia's Sputnik humiliated the US in the middle of the
Fifties, America came back hard with the Mercury Program, John Glenn and all
that, crash-funded through a new agency directly under the Secretary of Defense
- ARPA.
</p>

<p>
When the US space program was moved out of the military to become NASA, ARPA
was left with a lot of funding momentum and not much program. Into this vacuum
stepped J.C.R. Licklider among others, with the suggestion that since the
Defense Department was the world's largest user of computers, it would do well
to support large-scale basic research in computer science. It was ARPA's policy
in those days that basic research be neither secret nor limited to military
purposes, which boded well for exploration in an information-medium like
computers.
</p>

<p>
So in 1963 a fraction of ARPA's budget, some $5-8 million, went into a program
called IPT, Information Processing Techniques, under the initial direction of
Licklider and then of a 26-year-old named Ivan Sutherland. Sutherland, the
developer of "Sketchpad" at MIT, gave the agency its bias toward interactive
graphics and its commitment to "blue sky mode" research. The next director, Bob
Taylor, then 32, doubled IPT's budget (while ARPA's overall budget was
shrinking) and administered a five-year golden age in computer research.
</p>

<p>
The beauty was, that being at the very top of the Defense Establishment, the
agency had little Congressional scrutiny and little bureaucratic
responsibility, able to take creative chances and protect long-term deep-goal
projects. Alan Kay: "90 percent of all good things that I can think of that
have been done in computer science have been done funded by that agency.
Chances that they would have been funded elsewhere are very low. The basic ARPA
idea is that you find good people and you give them a lot of money and then you
step back. If they don't do good things in three years they get dropped&mdash;where
'good' is very much related to new or interesting."
</p>

<p>
Legends abound from early ARPA days, full of freedom and weirdness. Here's one
of many from Project MAC (Multiple Access Computer) days&mdash;Alan Kay: "They had
a thing on the PDP-l called 'The Unknown Glitch' ["Glitch"&mdash;a kink, a
less-than-fatal but irritating fuck-up]. They used to program the thing either
in direct machine code, direct octal, or in DDT. In the early days it was a
paper-tape machine. It was painful to assemble stuff, so they never listed out
the programs. The programs and stuff just lived in there, just raw seething
octal code. And one of the guys wrote a program called 'The Unknown Glitch,'
which at random intervals would wake up, print out <b class="smallcaps">I Am
The Unknown Glitch. Catch Me If You Can</b>, and then it would relocate itself
somewhere else in core memory, set a clock interrupt, and go back to sleep.
There was no way to find it."
</p>

<p>
One of the accomplishments of ARPA-funded research during this time was
time-sharing. Time-sharing is a routing technique that allows a large number of
users to sit down "on-line" with a computer as if each were all alone with it.
Naturally, timesharing was of no interest to computer manufacturers like IBM
since it meant drastically more efficient use of their hardware, and they were
still a long way from saturating their market with old technology. Only after
ARPA had developed time-sharing <em>and</em> its research-center market in the
mid-Sixties did the manufacturers adopt the innovation and make it available to
the rest of us. There's a political/economic moral in this story somewhere; I
think it has to do with the benefits of variant parallel systems.
</p>

<p>
ARPA is a rare but not completely isolated instance of enlightened government
research. For years the Office of Naval Research funded the most outstanding
work in pure mathematics without any hope of benefits for war-making.
</p>

<p>
In 1969 the political climate at ARPA changed with the passing into law of the
Mansfield Amendment, which required that military-funded research serve only
clearly military goals and answer to Congress on the matter. In other words,
the Defense Department was forbidden to try to obsolesce itself. Bob Taylor
departed ARPA.
</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p>
The next (and current) director at ARPA-IPT was Larry Roberts, a brilliant
researcher who had developed the first 3-D vision programs. His major project
has been getting the ARPA Network up. ("Up" around computers means working,
the opposite of "down" or crashed.) The dream for the Net was that researchers
at widely separated facilities could share special resources, dip into each
other's files, and even work on-line together on design problems too complex to
solve alone.
</p>

<p>
At present some 20 major computer centers are linked on the two-year-old ARPA
Net. Traffic on the Net has been very slow,  due to delays and difficulties of
translation between different computers and divergent projects. Use has
recently begun to increase as researchers travel from center to center and want
to keep in touch with home base, and as more tantalizing, sharable resources
come available. How Net usage will evolve is uncertain. There's a curious mix
of theoretical fascination and operational resistance around the scheme. The
resistance may have something to do with reluctances about equipping a future
Big Brother and his Central Computer. The fascination resides in the thorough
rightness of computers as communications instruments, which implies some
revolutions.
</p>

<p>
One popular new feature on the Net is AI's Associated Press service. From
anywhere on the Net you can log in and get the news that's coming live over the
wire or ask for all the items on a particular subject that have come in during
the last 24 hours. Plus a fortune cookie. Project that to household terminals,
and so much for newspapers (in present form).
</p>

<p>
Since huge quantities of information can be computer-digitalized and
transmitted, music researchers could, for example, swap records over the Net
with "essentially perfect fidelity." So much for record stores (in present
form).
</p>

<p>
I asked Alan Kay if Spacewar had been played over the Net. He said it's
possible. I asked if there'd been international Spacewar yet, and was told a
story. "There's a problem there of sending code groups. When Greenblatt's chess
program reigned supreme, they tried to play one of the Russian chess programs.
Instead of doing it by mail or using an international phone call they decided
to do it by amateur radio. There's this federal statute against transmitting
code groups of any kind, including chess moves. It took a long time to
straighten that out. There was eventual communication with the Russians through
a ham link in Switzerland."
</p>

<p>
True hackers. Who won?
</p>

<p>
"Greenblatt's program won. It's called 'MAC Hack 6.' It was a Class C player,
and has since been superseded by a couple of other programs." Poor Russia. Do
they regret Sputnik and the dialectical forces it unleashed?
</p>

<p id="the-research-park">
The western pole of the U.S. electronics research and manufacturing axis is the
San Francisco Peninsula; the eastern end is Boston's Route 128. The tilt of
talent is westward.
</p>

<p>
Xerox Research Center is an idyll, a new building high on an oak-savannahed
golden foothill in Stanford's industrial park in Palo Alto, California, a
blue-skied shimmery threatless landscape. "Every time I think of that place I
start to scratch my balls. It makes me nervous," argues dome and solar designer
Steve Baer from dusty Albuquerque, recalling that most of the evil he knows has
emitted from similar ivory towers.
</p>

<p>
Alan Kay, 32, child prodigy (National Quiz Kid at ten), former musician and
artist, worked with Ivan Sutherland and Dave Evans at Utah, presently a
researcher at Xerox. Alan shifts comfortably in his office bean-bag chair and
appraises his colleagues. "This is really a frightening group, by far the best
I know of as far as talent and creativity. The people here all have track
records and are used to dealing lightning with both hands."
</p>

<p>
Peter Deutsch, bearded and intent, 26, veteran of the early days at Project
MAC, has served on every major front in computer science, now has a cubicle
near Kay's at Xerox Research Center. Alan remarks on his neighbor, "Peter is in
my opinion the world's greatest programmer. He's much more than a hacker,
although he has some of that style. He's a virtuoso; his programs have very few
mistakes. He has probably more written code running than anybody in the ARPA
community."
</p>

<p>
But Peter doesn't work for ARPA any more. One who does, Smokey, at Stanford
Research Institute Augmentation Research Center, tells Peter, "You get just a
few more agates in that group and you'll have <em>all</em> the marbles."
</p>

<p class="intro">
<span class="runin">The chief</span> marble collector is&mdash;well, well&mdash;Bob
Taylor. When he left the newly restricted ARPA he spent a year at Utah
decompressing from the Pentagon and then went to Xerox and there continued his
practice of finding and rewarding good men for doing pretty much whatever they
considered important work. Freedom to explore in the company of talent is an
irresistible lure. In two years Xerox had twenty of the best men around
working. Toward what? Well, whatever.
</p>

<p>
I ask Bob Taylor about his position at Xerox. "It's not very sharply defined.
You could call me a research planner." He's Texas born, trained in experimental
psychology, soft-spoken. Where Alan Kay would summarize one of Taylor's papers
with the statement "Economy of scale is one of the biggest frauds ever
invented," Taylor will respond to a question about the economics of massive
operations like huge computer complexes with a long look, a puff of pipe smoke,
and a remark that "the benefits are less than claimed."
</p>

<p>
And that is the general bent of research at Xerox, soft, away from hugeness and
centrality, toward the small and the personal, toward putting maximum computer
power in the hands of every individual who wants it.
</p>

<p>
In one direction this means the automated office, replacing paper, desk and
phone with an interactive console&mdash;affording the possibility of doing the
whole of city work in a country cottage. The basic medium here is the text
manipulation system developed at Doug Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center,
which, as Doug puts it, allows you to "fly" formerly unreachable breadths and
depths of your information matrix of your knowledge. Ask for item so-and-so
from your file; <i>blink,</i> there it is. Make some changes; it's changed.
Designate keywords there and there; done. Request a definition of that word;
<i>blink</i>, presented. Find a quote from a document in a friend's file;
<i>blink, blink, blink,</i> found. Behind that statement add a substatement
giving cross-references and cross-access; provided. Add a diagram and two
photos; sized and added. Send the entire document to the attention of these
people; sent. Plus one on paper to mail to Washington; <i>gzzaap,</i> hardcopy,
with an addressed envelope.
</p>

<p>
That's for grownups. Alan Kay is more interested in us kids. He repudiates the
manipulative arrogance of "Computer-Aided Instruction"  and serves the dictum
of Seymour Papert, "Should the computer program the kid or should the kid
program the computer?"
</p>

<p>
Alan is designing a hand-held stand-alone interactive-graphic computer (about
the size, shape and diversity of a Whole Earth Catalog, electric) called
"Dynabook." It's mostly high-resolution display screen, with a keyboard on the
lower third and various cassette-loading slots, optional hook-up plugs, etc.
His colleague Bill English describes the fantasy thus:
</p>

<p>
"It stores a couple of million characters of text and does all the text
handling for you&mdash;editing, viewing, scanning, things of that nature. It'll
have a graphics capability which'll let you make sketches, make drawings. Alan
wants to incorporate music in it so you can use it for composing. It has the
Smalltalk language capability which lets people program their own things very
easily. We want to interface them with a tinker-toy kind of thing. And of
course it plays Spacewar."
</p>

<p>
The drawing capability is a program that Kay designed called "Paintbrush."
Working with a stylus on the display screen, you reach up and select a shape of
brush, then move the brush over and pick up a shade of half-tone-screen you
like, then paint with it. If you make a mistake, paint it out with "white." The
screen simultaneously displays the image you're working on and a one-third
reduction of it, where the dot pattern becomes a shaded half-tone.
</p>

<p>
A Dynabook could link up with other Dynabooks, with library facilities, with
the telephone, and it could go and hide where a child hides. Alan is determined
to keep the cost below $500 so that school systems could provide Dynabooks free
out of their textbook budgets. If Xerox Corporation decides to go with the
concept and expand out of its office equipment rut, the Dynabooks could be
available in two or three years, but that's up to Product Development, not Alan
or the Research Center.
</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p>
Peter Deutsch comments: "Processors and memories are getting smaller and
cheaper. Five years ago the idea of a Dynabook would have been absolutely
ridiculous. Now it merely seems difficult .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The emergence of
computers into society at large has come from a completely different quarter
than you'd expect, namely the small calculating machine manufacturers. The
current ultimate step in that direction is the Hewlett-Packard Pocket
Calculator. They sell for $400, and they're essentially a small computer with
no program and very little storage. Wang Laboratories makes calculators which
are really computers in all but name&mdash;they're programmable; they have lots of
storage. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But still these things only reach thousands of people,
not millions. They'll reach millions when computer power becomes like telephone
power. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think it's important to bring computing to the
people."
</p>

<h2>
Counter-computer
</h2>

<p class="intro">
<span class="runin">How mass</span> use of computers might go is not even
slightly known as yet, except for obvious applications in the schools. One
informative place to inquire is among the hackers, particularly at night when
they're pursuing their own interests.
</p>

<p>
One night at a computer center (nameless) I wandered off from the Spacewar game
to a clattering printout machine where a (nameless) young man with a trim beard
was scanning columns of entries like, "Pam $1.59, Bud $14.75, Annie $2.66." He
was an employee taking advantage of unbusy after hours time on the computer
(computers are never turned off) to run his commune accounts.
</p>

<p>
"Money seems to be a very sensitive issue," he explained, "more sensitive than
sex, even. People in the house who went on vacation for a week didn't want to
be charged for the food during that time and so forth. It was taking me hours
and hours every month to figure out people's house bills. Now it takes about a
half hour a month. Every week I stick up a list on the refrigerator, and anyone
who buys food or anything for the house writes it down on the list. I type all
that into the computer, along with the mortgage payment and the phone bills and
the gas bill. The House Bill Program goes around and divides up the common
charges and adds in all the special charges and figures out exactly who owes
who how much. Each person at the end of the month gets a bill plus a complete
breakdown of what their money goes to."
</p>

<p>
That's pretty good. What else goes on around here in moonlight mode?
</p>

<p>
"A friend of mine has his recording tape library index on the computer.
Everyone does their term papers and their theses on it. It'll justify margins,
incorporate corrections, handle illustrations, paging, footnotes, headings,
indexing. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two years ago when we had the great faculty strike
against the War, we rigged up a program that would type out a form letter to
all your congressmen and type in your name and address.
</p>

<p>
"Bruce is working on an astrology program. You put in your birthplace and date,
down to the minute, and it gives you all your aspects, your chart. You can get
your progress chart too .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One of the hackers is building a
computer at home out of Army surplus parts, and he's using the facilities here
to help his design, because we have this huge battery of computer design
programs."
</p>

<p>
Indeed. Far beyond borrowing some one else's computer is having your
<em>own</em> computer. Hear now the saga of Pam Hart and Resource One. In 1969
Pam was a computer programmer at Berkeley who found the work "just too
disillusioning. Then during the Cambodia Invasion demonstrations in Berkeley a
group of us got together and designed a retrieval program for coordinating all
of the actions on campus. It was a fairly dead system, but what it did was it
brought together people who had never worked together before and started them
talking and thinking about how it was actually possible to do something
positive with technology, when <em>you</em> define the goals."
</p>

<p>
Computing power to the people. So began one of the great hustles of modern
times. Peter Deutsch is still awed: "Pam could hustle blood from a turnip." She
speaks quietly in a hasty, gentle, self-effacing murmur. You have to lean close
to hear the lady helping you help her to plant dynamite in the very heart of
the Combine.
</p>

<p>
"Four of us came from Berkeley to Project One and set up in a little office on
the second floor. [Project One is a factory warehouse in the south-of-Market
area of San Francisco. It started in 1970 with a radio announcement: "If you're
interested in building a community and cheap space and sharing resources, come
to Project One." Within two weeks the building was filled with 200 artists,
craftsmen, technicians and ex-professionals, and their families.] We worked on
designing a retrieval system so all the switchboards in the City could
interact, using a common data base, with all the care taken for privacy and
knowing who put stuff in so you could refer back. Hopefully you could generate
lists that were updated and be as on-line as possible.
</p>

<p>
"We found that it just did not work using borrowed time, stolen time, bought
time&mdash;we couldn't afford it. So about a year later we set about getting
surplus. After a couple of months of calling everybody in San Francisco that
was related to computers, Trans-america said that they had three XDS 940s in a
warehouse [each costing $300,000 new]
</p>

<p>
"We negotiated the contract, got a 940 [free], which we refurbished. It arrived
last April; we installed it in June. It was probably the fastest machine
installation ever: We had it up in three days. We were really fortunate the
whole time. We had a lot of people from Xerox Park, a lot of the old people
from Berkeley Computer Corporation, that have assisted us in areas where we
weren't totally sure of the appropriate thing to do ourselves. Peter Deutsch
brought up the operating system.
</p>

<p>
"Now we're a little more stable economically. We got a foundation grant of
$10,000 last November from Stern. Then we borrowed $8000 from the Whole Earth
Catalog, of which we paid back six. [News to me. This was part of the $20,000 I
had turned over to the mob at the Catalog Demise Party. One Fred Moore finally
signed for $15,000 of it and ran a series of subsequent consensus money
decidings, which evidently were susceptible to Pam's soft voice and clear
head.] After two years we're right there at the beginning point of actually
being able to do the things that we said we wanted to do.
</p>

<p>
"One of the first things we have to do is have a retrieval system that's
general enough that it can handle things like Switchboard referral information,
also people who are doing investigative work on corporations, people doing
research on foundations, a whole lot of different groups either willing or not
willing to share data bases.
</p>

<p>
"We're interested in some health care statistical systems. There are a lot of
Free Clinics in the city, and they have to do all of their work by hand. We
want to incorporate a system doing statistical work for the clinics, charging
the Health Centers that have money and not charging the Free Clinics that don't
have money.
</p>

<p>
"A third area is using government generated tapes like assessor's tapes and
census tapes, and start trying to do some analysis of the city. And the
education program. The ideas include what Dymax is doing&mdash;set up a little
recreation center where people could come and play games and hopefully some of
them would be learning games. And then I'm interested in doing community
education with video tape. People want to know about computers, not how to use
them, necessarily, but how they're used against them."
</p>

<p>
Counter-computer. At present there are ten people in the core group at Resource
One ranging in age from 19 to 30 (Pam is 25), with decisions made by consensus.
</p>

<p>
Another scheme in the works involves the people around Steve Beck at the
National Center for Experiments in Television a few blocks away. Steve has
built the world's first real-time video synthesizer&mdash;the video equivalent of
the Moogs, Buchlas, and Arps of music synthesis. It's a natural to link up with
a computer.  The current plan is for Steve and his equipment to move into the
basement below Resource One, which should liven up the scene&mdash;Pam's gang is
short on true hacker time-wasting frivolity; they're warm, but rather stodgier
than some of the Government-funded folks. Maybe the video link-up will give us
some higher levels of Spacewar on the way to exploring new territory entirely.
In what directions the computer-use at Resource One evolves should be of
interest. If I were a computer manufacturer I'd pay the closest attention and
maybe donate some goodies.
</p>

<h2>
Control and Spontaneity
</h2>

<p class="intro">
<span class="runin">I'm no</span> manufacturer, but I'm a hungry enough
potential user to pretend briefly that I know what I'm talking about and run a
trial polemic .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
Until computers come to the people we will have no real idea of their most
natural functions. Up to the present their cost and size has kept them in the
province of rich and powerful institutions, who, understandably, have developed
them primarily as bookkeeping, sorting and control devices. The computers have
been a priceless aid in keeping the lid on top-down organization. They are
splendidly impressive as oracles of (programmable) Truth, the lofty voice of
unchangeable authority.
</p>

<p>
In fact, computers don't know shit. Their special talent in the direction of
intelligence is the ability to make elabrate models and fiddle with them, to
answer in detail questions that begin "What if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;?" In this they
parallel (and can help) the acquiring of intelligence by children. But the
basic fact of computer use is "Garbage In, Garbage Out"&mdash;if you feed the
computer nonsense, it will dutifully convert your mistake into insanity-cubed
and feed it back to you. Children are different&mdash;"Garbage In, Food Out" is
common with them. Again, the benefits of variant parallel systems. Computer
function is mostly one-track-mind, in which inconsistency is intolerable. The
human mind functions on multiple tracks (not all of them accessible); it can
tolerate and even thrive on inconsistency.
</p>

<p>
I suggest that the parallel holds for the overall picture of computer use.
Where a few brilliantly stupid computers can wreak havoc, a host of modest
computers (and some brilliant ones) serving innumerable individual purposes can
be healthful, can repair havoc, feed life. (Likewise, 20 crummy speakers at
once will give better sound fidelity than one excellent speaker&mdash;try it.)
</p>

<p>
Spacewar serves Earthpeace. So does any funky playing with computers or any
computer-pursuit of your own peculiar goals, and especially any use of
computers to offset other computers. It won't be so hard. The price of hardware
is coming down fast, and with the new CMOS chips (Complimentary Metal Oxide
Semiconductor integrated circuits) the energy-drain of major computing drops to
flashlight-battery level.
</p>

<p>
Part of the grotesqueness of American life in these latter days is a
subservience to Plan that amounts to panic. What we don't intend <em>shouldn't
happen</em>. What happens anyway is either blamed on our enemies or baldly
ignored. In our arrogance we close our ears to voices not our rational own, we
reject the princely gifts of spontaneous generation.
</p>

<p>
Spacewar as a parable is almost too pat. It was the illegitimate child of the
marrying of computers and graphic displays. It was part of no one's grand
scheme. It served no grand theory. It was the enthusiasm of irresponsible
youngsters. It was disreputably competitive. ("You killed me, Tovar!") It was
an administrative headache. It was merely delightful.
</p>

<p>
Yet Spacewar, if anyone cared to notice, was a flawless crystal ball of things
to come in computer science and computer use:
</p>

<ol>
<li>It was intensely interactive in real time with the computer.</li>
<li>It encouraged new programming by the user.</li>
<li>It bonded human and machine through a responsive broadband interface of
  live graphics display.</li>
<li>It served primarily as a communication device between humans.</li>
<li>It was a game.</li>
<li>It functioned best on stand-alone equipment (and disrupted multiple-user
  equipment).</li>
<li>It served human interest, not machine. (Spacewar is trivial to a
  computer.)</li>
<li>It <em>was</em> delightful.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In those days of batch processing and passive consumerism (data was something
you sent to the manufacturer, like color film), Spacewar was heresy, uninvited
and unwelcome.
</p>

<p>The hackers made Spacewar, not the planners.</p>

<p>
When computers become available to everybody, the hackers take over: We are all
Computer Bums, all more empowered as individuals and as co-operators. That
might enhance things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like the richness and rigor of spontaneous
creation and of human interaction .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of sentient interaction.

<h2>Access to Computers</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>
As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Moorer">Andy Moorer</a> puts
it, "Basically all you have to do is read a book on computer programming,
and you're an instant computer scientist." Alan Kay insists that most of
computer science can be mastered in one year of close attention. That's how
young a science it is.
</p>

<p>
The main thing is getting with computers. If you live near a university or have
family in a business that uses computers, you may be able to wangle moonlight
time and informal instruction.
</p>

<p>
If you're in school (college, high school, grade or Free) it shouldn't be too
hard to con them into buying some decent equipment&mdash;tell them they can use it
for school accounts at night. According to
<a href="http://iae-pedia.org/Robert_Albrecht">Bob Albrecht</a> of Dymax
(People's Computer Company), the best school computers are from DEC and H-P:
"Both of these companies have made a real commitment. They have qualified
educational staff, they're developing new stuff, they've got credibility."

the 2000C ($300K).
</p>

<p>
Some school systems are starting miniature ARPA Nets. Bob Albrecht reports,
"Minnesota may become the first state to have a statewide network where every
kid will have access to a computer. There are more than 200 schools already
tied into the network. And Long Island has a consortium with 40 schools on a
PDP-10."

<h3>II</h3>
<h2>Your Own Spacewar</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>
Though no one has done it yet, Alan Kay is convinced a modest Spacewar could be
built cheap: "You can do motion with a couple of integrators.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit">Heathkit</a> has this
l6-integrator analogue computer you can build as a kit for 700 bucks or
something like that. You have to have two layers of integrators to get an
inverse-square law, so you should be able to get gravity and orbits with that
one. To make spaceship outlines and explosion patterns you need a few bits of
digital memory. Two chips worth of register file should do it. I think
electronics stores may carry the chips.
</p>

<p>
"The controls for Spacewar are trivial. The simplest way is to go to a radio
control store&mdash;like for model airplanes&mdash;and get the front end of the radio
controller, which has two sets of joysticks and the pots and everything else.
You can use those as the inputs to the analogue computer. They only cost
something like thirty bucks." Once you have the computer, your own or someone
else's, you can write your own Spacewar program or start with this one of
Kay's:
