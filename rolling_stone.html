<hr>

<p>
Ready or not, computers are coming to the people. 

<p>
That&rsquo;s good news, maybe the best since psychedelics.
It&rsquo;s way off the track of the
&ldquo;Computers - Threat or menace?&rdquo; school of liberal
criticism but surprisingly in line with
the romantic fantasies of the forefathers
of the science such as
Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch,
J.C.R. Licklider, John von Neumann and Vannevar Bush.

<p>
The trend owes its health to an odd array of influences:
The youthful fervor and firm dis-Establishmentarianism
of the freaks who design computer science;
an astonishingly enlightened research program from the very top of the
Defense Department; an unexpected market-Banking movement by the
manufacturers of small calculating machines, and an irrepressible
midnight phenomenon known as Spacewar.

<p>
Reliably, at any nighttime
moment (i.e. non-business hours) in North America hundreds of computer
technicians are effectively out of their bodies, locked in
life-or-death space combat computer-projected onto cathode ray tube
display screens, for hours at a time, ruining their eyes, numbing
their fingers in frenzied mashing of control buttons, joyously slaying
their friend and wasting their employers&rsquo; valuable computer
time. Something basic is going on. 

<p>
Rudimentary Spacewar consists of
two humans, two sets of control buttons or joysticks, one TV-like
display and one computer. Two spaceships are displayed in motion on
the screen, controllable for thrust, yaw, pitch and the firing of
torpedoes. Whenever a spaceship and torpedo meet, they disappear in
an attractive explosion. That's the original version invented in 1962
at MIT by Steve Russell. (More on him in a moment.)

<p>
October, 1972, 8 PM,
at <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/">Stanford&rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Laboratory</a>, moonlit and
remote in the foothills above Palo Alto, California.
Two dozen of us are jammed in a semi-dark console room
just off the main hall containing AI&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10">PDP-10</a> computer.
AI&rsquo;s Head System Programmer and most avid Spacewar nut,
Ralph Gorin, faces a display screen which says only:

<p>
<b>THIS CONSOLE AVAILABLE.</b>
<br>
He logs in on the keyboard with his initials:
Click clickclickclick click.
<br>

<b>

<br>
CSD FALL PICNIC. SATURDAY 11 AM IN FLOOD PARK . . .
<br>
</b>

He interrupts further announcements, including one
about the &ldquo;First Intergalactic Spacewar Olympics&rdquo; at 8 PM, with:

Click (&ldquo;run&rdquo;)

(&ldquo;Space War Ralph&rdquo;) click (&ldquo;do it&rdquo;)

<b>

</pre>
</type>

<p>
Immediately the screen goes dark and then displays: Five different
space ships, each with a dot indicating torpedo tubes are loaded,
five scores, each at zero, a convincing starfield, and four space mines
orbiting around a central sun,
toward which the spaceships are
starting to fall at a correctly accelerating rate.

<p>
Players seize the five sets of control buttons,
find their spaceship persona on the screen,
and simultaneously turn and fire toward any nearby still-helpless
spaceships, hit the thrust button to initiate orbit before being
slurped by the killer sun, and evade or shoot down any incoming enemy
torpedoes or orbiting mines. After two torpedoes are fired, each
ship has a three second unarmed &ldquo;reloading&rdquo; time.
Fired torpedoes last nine seconds and then disappear.

<p>
As kills are made the scores start to change
+1 for a successful kill, -1 for being killed,
+1 for being lone survivor of a battle.
Personalities begin to establish themselves 
in the maneuvering spaceahips: The pilot of the ship called

<i>Pointy Fins</i> is a dead shot but panics easily in cross fire.

<i>Roundback</i> tries to avoid early dueling and
routinely fires two torpedoes "around the universe" (off
the screen, so they reappear lethally unexpected from the opposite side).

<i>Birdie</i> drives for the sun and a fast orbit, has excellent agility in sensing
and facing toward hazard.

<i>Funny Fins</i> shouts a lot, singling out individual opponents.

<i>Flatback</i> is silent and maintains an uncanny field-sense of the
whole battlesky, impervious to surprise attack.

<p>
A game is over when only one or no survivors are displayed.
The screen then blanks out, counts down 5-4-3-2-1, 
and redisplays a new battle with ships at new random
positions equidistant from the sun and showing scores
accumulative from previous games. A spaceship that is killed
early in a battle will reincarnate after 16 seconds and rejoin the fray, so that a
single battle may last up to five minutes with a weak player perishing
several times in it.

<p>
The twenty or so raucous competitors in
the Spacewar Olympics quickly organize three events:
Five-Player Free-For-All,
Team Competition (two against two),
and Singles Competition.
The executive officer of the AI Project, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Earnest">Les Earnest</a>,
who kindly OKed these Olympics and their visibility,
is found to have no immediate function and is sent out for beer.

<p>
The setting and decor at AI is
Modern Mad Scientist  -  long hallways and cubicles and
large windowless rooms, brutal fluoresccnt light, enormous machines
humming and clattering, robots on wheels, scurrying arcane technicians.
And, also, posters and announcements against the
Vietnam War and Richard Nixon,
computer print-out photos of
girlfriends, a hallway-long banner
<b>SOLVING TODAY&rsquo;S PROBLEMS TOMORROW</b>
and signs on every door in Tolkien&rsquo;s elvish F&euml;anorian script
 -  the director&rsquo;s office is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imladris">Imladris</a>,
the coffee room The Prancing Pony,
the computer room Mordor.
There&rsquo;s a lot of hair on those technicians,
and nobody seems to be telling them where to scurry,

<p>
The games progress.
A tape recorder kibitzes on the first round of Team Competition, 
four ships twisting, converging, evading, exploding:

<!--	PAGE 51 ROLLING STONE / DECEMBER 7, 1972
	========================================
-->

. . . Four intense hours, much frenzy and skilled concerted action,
a 15-ring circus in ten different directions, the most
bzz-bzz-busy scene I&rsquo;ve been around since Merry Prankster Acid
Tests . . . and really it&rsquo;s just a normal night at the AI Project, at any
suitably hairy computer research project. Something basic ...

<p>
These are heads, most of them.
Half or more of computer science is heads.
But that's not it.
The rest of the counterculture is laid low and back these days,
showing none of this kind of zeal. What, then?

<h2>
The Hackers
</h2>

I&rsquo;m guessing that Alan Kay at Xerox Research Center (more on them
shortly) has a line on it, defining the standard Computer Bum:
&ldquo;About as straight as you&rsquo;d expect hotrodders to look.
It&rsquo;s that kind of fanaticism.

A true hacker is not a group person.
He&rsquo;s a person who loves to stay up all night,
he and the machine in a love-hate relationship...

They&rsquo;re kids who tended to be brilliant but not very
interested in conventional goals. And computing is just a fabulous
place for that, because it&rsquo;s a place where you don't have to be a
Ph.D. or anything else. It&rsquo;s a place where you can still be an
artisan. People are willing to pay you if you're any good at all, and
you have plenty of time for screwing around.&rdquo;

<p>
The hackers are the technicians of this science  -  
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a term of derision and also the ultimate compliment.&rdquo;
They are the ones who translate human demands into code
that the machines can understand and act on. They are
legion. Fanatics with a potent new toy.
A mobile new-found elite, with its own apparat,
language and character, its own legends and humor.
Those magnificent men with their flying machines,
scouting a leading edge of technology
which has an odd softness to it;
outlaw country, where rules are not decree
or routine so much as the starker demands of what&rsquo;s possible.

<p>
A young science travels where the young take it. The wiser computer
research directors have learned that not trusting their young
programmers with major responsibility can lead immediately to no
research. AI is one of perhaps several dozen computer research
centers that are flourishing with their young, some of them with no
more formal education than they got at the local Free School.

I&rsquo;m talking to Les Earnest, the gent who went for beer. He&rsquo;s tall,
swarthy, has a black and white striped beard, looks like a Sufi
athlete. He&rsquo;s telling me about what else people build here besides
refinements of Spacewar.

There&rsquo;s a speech recognition project.
There's the hand-eye project, in which the computer is
learning to see and visually correct its robot functions.
There's work on symbolic computation
and grammatical inference.

Work with autistic children,
&lsquo;trying to get them to relate to computers first,
and then later to people. This seems to be successful in part
because many of these children think of themselves as machines.
You can encourage them to interact in a game with the machine.&rdquo;
<p>
Another window on the interests
of AI and of the hackers is a
posted printout of the file of AI&rsquo;s system programs, 
some 250 elaborate routines available. Scanning:

<p>
A distinction exists between low-rent and high-rent computer research,
between preoccupations of support group-(hackers) and of research group.
The distinction blurs often. Les Earnest: &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s
hard to tell the difference between recreation and work, happily. We
try to judge people not on how much time they waste but on what they
accomplish over fairly long periods of time, like a half year to a
year.&rdquo; He adds that Spacewar players &ldquo;are more from the support groups
than the research groups. The research groups tend to get their kicks
out of research.&rdquo;<p>
Spacewar is low-rent.

<h2>
Spacewar
</h2>


Low-rent ... but pervasive.
Alan Kay: &ldquo;The game of Spacewar blossoms spontaneously 
wherever there is a graphics display connected to a computer.&rdquo;

<p>
The first opportunity was at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) Electrical Engineering Department back in
1961-1962. 
The earliest mini-computer, Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-1,
was installed in the kludge room with a cathode ray tube
display hooked on.

("Kludge"  -  any lash-up often involving chewing
gum, paper dips, scotch tape; it works if no one trips over a wire;
unadaptable"" a working mess.)

There it was that Steve Russell and his fellow hackers
Alan Kotok, Peter Samson and Dan Edwards
introduced Spacewar to the world.

<p>
I phoned Russell at the sprawling
old fabric mill in Maynard, Massachusetts, where Digital Equipment
Corporation manufactures the most popular research and education
computers on the market.

Russell currently is a researcher for them
working on man-machine interface problems  - adapting computer
nature to fit human nature.

Back in 1962 he was a hacker, 23 or so,
a math major two years out of Dartmouth
working in the brand new field
of computer science for John McCarthy at MIT.

<p>
His account of the invention of
Spacewar is not only intriguing history,
it's the most,sophisticated analysis
of good game design I've ever run across  -  elegant
work. But that's in retrospect;
back then it was just kids staying up all night.

<p>
"We had this brand new PDP-l," Steve Russell recalls.
"It was the first minicomputer, ridiculously inexpensive for its
time. And it was just sitting there.

It had a console typewriter that worked right, 
which was rare, and a paper tape reader and a cathode
ray tube display,

[There had been CRT displays before, but primarily
in the Air Defense System.]

Somebody had built some little pattern-generating 
programs which made interesting patterns like a
kaleidoscope. Not a very good demonstration.
Here was this display that could do all sorts of good things! 
So we started talking about it,
figuring what would be interesting displays.
We decided that probably you could
make a two-Dimensional maneuvering sort of thing,
and decided that naturally the obvious thing to do was spaceships."

<p>
Naturally?

<p>
&ldquo;I had just finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Smith">Doc Smith</a>&rsquo;s Lensman series.
He was some sort of scientist
but he wrote this really dashing brand of science fiction.
The details were very good and it had an excellent pace.
His heroes had a strong tendency to get pursued by the villain
across the galaxy and have to invent their way out of their problem
while they were being pursued. That sort of action was the thing that
suggested Spacewar. He had some very glowing descriptions of
spaceship encounters and space fleet maneuvers.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Smith: 
&ldquo;The <i>Boise</i> leaped upon the Nevian, every weapon aflame.
But, as Costigan had expected, Nerado's vessel
was completely ready far any emergency.
And, unlike her sister-ship, she was manned by scientists
well-versed in the fundamental theory of the weapons with which they
fought. Beams, rods and lances of energy flamed and flared; planes and
pencils cut, slashed and stabbed; defensive screens glowed redly or
flashed suddenly into intensely brilliant, coruscating
incandescence. Crimson opacity struggled sullenly against violet
curtains of annihilation. Material projectiles and torpedoes were
launched under full-beam control; only to be exploded harmlessly in
mid-space, to be blasted into nothingness or to disappear
innocuously against impenetrable polycyclic screens.&rdquo; 
 -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplanetary_(novel)">Triplanetary</a>(1948)

<p>
Steve Russell: "By picking a world which people weren't familiar with,
we could alter a number of parameters of the world in the interests of
making a good game and of making it possible to get it onto a
computer. We made a great deal of compromises from some of our
original grand plans in order to make it work well.

<p>
"One of the important things in Spacewar is the pace.
It's relatively fast-paced, and that makes it an interesting game.
It seems to be a reasonable compromise between action  -  pushing buttons  -  and
thought. Thought does help you,
and there are some tactical considerations,
but just plain fast reflexes also help. 


<!--

<p>
"It was quite interesting to fiddle with the parameters, which of course I
had to do to get it to be a really good game. By changing the
parameters you could change it anywhere from essentially just
random, where it was pure luck, to something where skill and ex-
experience counted above everything else. The normal choice is
somewhere between those two. With Spacewar an experienced player can
beat an amateur for maybe 20 to 50 games and then the amateur begins
to win a little."

<p>
The pride of any hacker with a new program is its
"features." Fresh forms of Spacewar with exotic new features
proliferated. As Russell explains it, everything at MIT had priority
over Spacewar, but it was an educational computer after all, and
developing new programs (of Spacewar) was educational, and then those
programs needed testing... The initial game of simply two spaceships
and their torpedoes didn't last long. 

<p>
Gravity was introduced. Then
Peter Samson wrote in the starfield with a program called "Expensive
Planetarium" (MIT's first text display had been called "Expensive
Typewriter"). Russell: "Having a background was important to give
some idea of range and so on. Our Spacewar did not have gravity
affecting the torpedoes  - our explanation was that they were photon
bombs and that they weren't affected by gravity. Subsequent versions
on newer computers have got enough compute time so that they can
afford to use gravity for the torpedoes, and that makes it a more
interesting game."

<p>
And then there came a - startling development
called Hyperspace  -  when your situation got desperate you could
push both turn buttons at once and go into hyperspace: disappear from
the screen for a few seconds and then reappear at a random new
position... maybe.

<p>
&ldquo;Hyperspace was in within a month or so,&rdquo; says
Russell. &ldquo;It's a little controversial. Some people deplore it, and
it's fairly common to play games without it.... It was of course
vital to put in problems with hyperspace. You know, when you come back
into normal space from hyperspace, there is initially a small
energy-well which looks amazingly like a star; if a torpedo is shot
into that energy well, lo and behold the ship blows up. There is also
a certain probability of blowing up as you finally break out of
hyperspace. Our explanation was that these were the Mark One
hyperfield generators and they hadn't done really a thorough job of
testing them  -  they had rushed them into the fleet. And
unfortunately the energies that were being dissipated in

the generators at breakout were juuust barely what they could handle. So the probability of the generator flying apart and completely killing the spaceship was noticeable on the first couple of uses, and after four uses it was only an even chance of surviving hyperspace. So it was something that you could use butit wasn't something that you wanted to use.&rdquo;

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Smith: <em>Twenty-odd years before, when the then </em>Dauntless<em> and her crew were thrown out of a hyper-spatial tube and into that highly enigmatic Nth space, LaVerne Thorndyke had been Chief Technician. Mentor of Arisia found them, and put into the mind of Sir Austin Cardynge, mathematician extraordinary, the knowledge of how to find the way back to normal space. Thorndyke, working under nerve-shattering difficulties, had been in charge of build the machines were were to enable to vessel to return to her home space. He built them. She returned.</em>
<p><em>&mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_the_Lens">Children of the Lens</a> (1954)</em>
<p>
</blockquote>
PETER DEUTSCH now at, Xerox ' Research Center, reminisces - about the
first Spacewar: &ldquo;The programming of the thing was a remarkable tour de
forge, because the machine did not have a multiply or divide, The way
that the outline of the spaceship was rotated was by compiling a
special-purpose program. Nice programming trick... Spacewar was ' not
an outgrowth of any work on computer-graphics, but it may have
inspired - some of it. That's speculation&rdquo;

<p>
Albert Kuhfeld, writing in July, 1971, Analog Magazine, reminisces,
&ldquo;The first few years of Spacewar at MIT were the best.
The game was in a rough state, students were working their hearts out improving it, 
and the faculty was nodding benignly as they watched.
the students learning computer theory faster and more painlessly
than they'd ever seen before...

And a background of real-time interactive programming
was being built up", that anybody in the school could draw on;
one of the largest
problem's in the development of the game was having . how to talk to a
computer program and have it answer back.&rdquo;<p>
Within weeks of its
invention Spacewar was spreading across the country to other
computer research centers, who began adding their own wrinkles.

<p>
There was a variation called Minnesota Hyperspace in which you kept your
position but became invisible; however if you applied thrust, your
rocket flame could be seen.... Score-keeping. Space mines, Partial
damage  - if hit in a fin you could not turn in that direction.

<p>
Then "2&frac12;-D" Spacewar, played on two consoles.
Instead of being God viewing the whole battle,
you're a mere pilot with a view put the front of your spaceship
and the difficult task of finding your enemy.
(Perspective could be compressed so that even though far away
the other ship would be large enough to see.)

<p>
Adding incentive, MIT
introduced an electric shock to go with the explosion of your ship.
A promising future is seen for sound effects. And now a few commercial
versions of Spacewar  - 25 cents a game  - are appearing in
university coffee shops.

<p>
Steve Russell still dreams: "Something
which I wanted to do is get some interesting sort of fleet
action. There are some versions of Spacewar which allow two, three
ships, but as far as I know no one has been sufficiently clever to set
things up so there are ships with noticeably different characteristics
that could fight in interesting combinations."
<p>
John Lilly (of dolphin, acid, and bio-computer fame) tells a story that
IBM once forbade the playing of Spacewar
by IBM researchers. After a few suddenly uncreative months of
joyless research the ban was rescinded. Apparently, frivolous
Spacewar had been the medium of important experiments. (In every
computer-business story I've ever heard, IBM invariably plays the
heavy.)

<p>
Les Earnest at AI confirms the moral.
For instance, at his lab the ingenious
device for handling interactive graphics on the
time-shared computer is galled, 
"Spacewar Mode" in honor of its origin.

<p>
Surprisingly, there have been relatively few Spacewar-like
games invented. The most elaborate is a "Snoopy and the Red Baron"
game which involves flying,pour console like a biplane. But computer
graphics as an area of research has mushroomed.

The field is too wide and deep and engrossing for me to report here.
It's an art form waiting for artists,
a consciousness form waiting for mystics.

<p>
All right, one sample:
the vision helmet designed by Ivan Sutherland at Harvard.
The helmet covers the front of your face with special
goggles that are tiny Co,puter-driven TV screens.

They present you with a visual space in which you can move. 
The computer monitors where your head moves and alters what you see accordingly.
In the projected reality you can look around,
you can look behind you, you can move toward things and through them.
You can furthermore change parameters.
Your head goes forward a foot and in the vision you soar a hundred yards.
Or you can travel in exaggerated relativistic space,
so that if you lunge at something it bends away.

Become a geometric point;
become enormous; live out Olaf Stapledon's Star Maker.

The letters stand for Advanced Research Projects Agency, one of the
rare success stories of Government action. Poetically enough it owes
its origin to real spacewar. After Russia's Sputnik humiliated the US
in the middle of the Fifties, America came back hard with the Mercury
Program, John Glenn and all that, crash-funded through a new agency
directly under the Secretary of Defense  -  ARPA.

<p>
When the US space
program was moved out of the military to become NASA, ARPA was left
with a lot of funding momentum and not much program. Into this
vacuum stepped J.C.R. Licklider among others, with the suggestion that
since the Defense Department was the world's largest user of
computers, it would do well to support
information-medium like computers. 

<p>
So in 1963 a fraction of ARPA's
budget, some $5-8 million, went into a program called IPT,
Information Processing Techniques, under the initial direction of
Licklider and then of a 26-year-old named Ivan Sutherland. Suth-
erland, the developer of "Sketchpad" at MIT, gave the agency its bias
toward interactive graphics and its commitment to "blue sky mode" re-
search. The next director, Bob Taylor, then 32, doubled I PT's
. budget (while ARPA's overall budget was shrinking) and administered
a five-year golden age in computer research.

<p>
The beauty was, that being at the
very top of the Defense Establishment, the agency had
little Congressional scrutiny had little bureaucratic responsibility,
able to take creative chances and protect long-term deep-goal
projects.

Alan Kay: "90 percent of all good things that I can think
of that have been done in computer science have been done funded by
that agency. Chances that they would have been funded elsewhere are
very low. The basic ARPA idea is that you find good people and you
give them a lot of money and then you step back. If they don't do good
things in three years they get dropped  - where 'good' is very much
related to new or interesting."

<p>
Legends abound from early ARPA days,
full of freedom and weirdness.
Here's one of many from Project MAC
(Multiple Access Computer) days - Alan Kay:

"They had a thing on the PDP-l called 'The Unknown Glitch' 
["Glitch"  -  a kink, a less-than-fatal but irritating fuck-up].

They used to program the thing either in direct machine code,
direct octal, or in DDT, In the early days it was a paper-tape machine.
It was painful to assemble stuff,
so they never listed out the programs. 
The programs and stuff just lived in there,
just raw seething octal code. And one of the guys
wrote a program called 'The Unknown Glitch,'
which at random intervals would wake up,
print out 
<b>I AM THE UNKNOWN GLITCH. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN</b>,
and then it would relocate itself somewhere else in core memory,
set a clock interrupt, and go back to sleep. There was no way to find it." 

<p>
One of the accomplishments of ARPA-funded research during this
time was time-sharing, Time-sharing is a routing technique that allows
a large number of users to sit down "on-line" with a. computer as if
each were all alone with it. Naturally, timesharing was of no interest
to computer manufacturers like IBM since it meant drastically morc
efficient use of their hardware, and they were still a long way

The next (and current) director at ARPA-IPT was Larry Roberts, a brilliant
researcher who had developed the first 3-D vision programs.

His major project has been getting the ARPA Network up.
("Up" around computers means working,
  the opposite of "down" or crashed.)

The dream for the Net was that researchers 
at widely separated facilities could share
special resources, dip into each other's files, and even work
on-line together on design problems too complex to solve alone.

<p>
At present some 20 major computer centers
are linked on the two-year-old ARPA Net.
Traffic on the Net has been very slow, 
due to delays and difficulties of translation between different computers
and divergent projects.
Use has recently begun to increase as researchers travel
from center to center and want to keep in touch with home base,
and as more tantalizing, sharable resources come available. 

How Net usage will evolve is uncertain.
There's a curious mix of theoretical fascination
and operational resistance around the scheme.
The resistance may have something to do with reluctances
about equipping a future Big Brother and his Central Computer.
The fascination resides in the thorough rightness of computers
as communications instruments, which implies some revolutions.

<p>
One popular new feature on the Net is
AI's Associated Press service. From anywhere on the Net you can log in
and get the news that's coming live over the wire or ask for all the
items on a particular subject that have come in during the last 24
hours. Plus a fortune cookie. Project that to household terminals, and
so much for newspapers (in present form). 

<p>
Since huge quantities of
information can be computer-digitalized and transmitted, music
researchers could, for example, swap records over the Net with
"essentially perfect fidelity." So much for record stores (in present
form).

<p>
I asked Alan Kay if Spacewar had been played over the Net.
He said it's possible.

I asked if there'd been international Spacewar yet,
and was told a story. "There's. a problem there of sending code
groups, When Greenblatt's chess program reigned supreme, they tried to
play one of. the Russian chess œ programs. Instead of doing it by mail
or using an international phone call ' they decided to do it by
amateur radio. i There's this federal statute against ' transmitting
code groups of any kind,; including chess moves. It took a long time
to straighten that out. There was eventual communication with the
Russians through a ham link in Switzerland."

<p>
True hackers. Who won? 
<p>
"Greenblatt's program won. It's called 'Mack Hack 6.'
It was a Class C player, and has since been 
superseded by a couple of other programs."
Poor Russia. Do they regret Sputnik and the 
dialectical forces it unleashed? 

<h2>The Research Park</h2>
<p>
THE WESTERN POLE of the U.S. electronics research and manufacturing axis is the San 
Francisco Peninsula; the eastern end is Boston's Route 128. The tilt of talent is westward. 
The Shy Research Center (not their real name) is an idyll, a new building high on 
an oak-savannahed golden foothill in Stanford's industrial park
in Palo Alto, California, a blue-skied  shimmery threatless landscape.
"Every time I think of that place I start to scratch my balls. It 
makes me nervous," argues dome and solar designer Steve Baer from dusty Albuquerque, 
recalling that most of the evil he knows has emitted from similar ivory towers.

<p>
Alan Kay, 32, child prodigy (National Quiz Kid at ten), 
former musician and artist, worked with Ivan Sutherland
and Dave Evans at Utah, presently a researcher at Xerox.
Alan shifts comfortably in his office bean-bag chair
and appraises his colleagues. "This is really a frightening group,
by far the best I know of as far as talent and creativity.
The people here all have track records
and are used to dealing lightning with both hands."

<p>
<img src=deutsch.jpg alt="Peter Deutsch" align=right>

Peter Deutsch, bearded and intent, 26, veteran of the early days at
Project MAC, has served on every major front in computer science, now
has a cubicle near Kay's at Xerox Research Center. Alan remarks on his
neighbor, "Peter is in my opinion the world's greatest
programmer. He's much more than a hacker, although he has some of that
style. He's a virtuoso; his programs have very few mistakes. He has
probably more written code running than anybody in the ARPA
community." 

<p>
But Peter doesn't work for ARPA any more. One who does,
Smokey, at Stanford Research Institute Augmentation Research Center,
tells Peter,
"You get just a few more agates
in that group and you'll have all the marbles."

<p>
The chief marble collector is  - well, well  -  Bob Taylor.
When he left the newly restricted ARPA
he spent a year at Utah decompressing from the Pentagon
and then went to Xerox and there continued his
practice of finding and rewarding good men for doing pretty much
whatever they considered important work.

Freedom to explore in the company of talent is an irresistible lure.
In two years Xerox had twenty of the best men around working. 
Toward what? Well, whatever.

<img src="parc.jpg" align=left alt="collage: Bob Taylor, Alan Jay, Stewart Brand, Parc Bean-Bag room">

<p> I ask Bob Taylor about his position at Xerox.
"It's not very sharply defined. You could call me a research planner."
He's Texas born, trained in experimental psychology, soft-spoken.
Where Alan Kay would summarize one of Taylor's papers with the statement
"Economy of scale is one of the biggest frauds ever invented,"
Taylor will respond to a question about
the economics of massive operations like huge computer
complexes with a long look, a puff of pipe smoke, and a remark that
"the benefits are less than claimed."

<!-- column#4 -->
<p>
And that is the general bent of research at Xerox, soft, away from
hugeness and centrality, toward the small and the personal, toward
putting maximum computer power in the hands of every individual who
wants it.

<p>
In one direction this means the automated office,
replacing paper, desk and phone with an interactive console  - 
affording the possibility of doing the whole of city work in a country
cottage. The basic medium here is the text manipulation system
developed at Doug Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center, which, as
Doug puts it, allows you to "fly" formerly unreachable breadths and
depths of your information matrix of your knowledge, Ask for item
so-and-so from your file; blink, there it is. Make some changes; it's
changed, Designate keywords there and there; done. Request a
definition of that word; blink, presented; Find a quote from a
document in a friend's file; blink, blink, blink, found. Behind that
statement add a substatement giving cross-references and cross-access;
provided. Add a diagram and two photos; sized and added. Send the
entire document to the attention of these people; sent. Plus one on
paper to mail to Washington; gzzaap, hardcopy, with an addressed
envelope.

<p>
That's for grownups.
Alan Kay is more interested in us kids
He repudiates the manipulative arrogance of "Computer-Aided Instruction" 
and serves the dictum of Seymour Papert,
Should the computer program the kid 
or should the kid program the computer?

<p>
Alan is designing a hand-held stand-alone interactive-graphic computer
(about the size, shape and diversity of a Whole Earth Catalog,
electric) called "Dynabook." It's mostly high-resolution display
screen, with a keyboard on the lower third and various cassette-
loading slots, optional hook-up plugs, etc. His colleague Bill English
describes the fantasy. thus:

<p>
"It stores a couple of million
characters of text and does all the text handling for you  - 
editing, viewing, scanning, things of that nature. It'll have a
graphics capability which'll let you make sketches, make
drawings. Alan wants to incorporate music in it so you can use it for
composing. It has the Smalltalk language capability which lets people
program their own things very easily. We want to interface them with a
tinker-toy kind of thing. And of course it plays Spacewar."

<p>
The drawing capability is a program that Kay designed called "Paintbrush."
Working with a stylus on the display screen, you 
reach up and select a shape of brush, then move the brush over
and pick up a shade of half-tone-screen you like,
then paint with it. If you make a mistake, paint it out with "white." The screen 
simultaneously displays the image you're working on and a one-third reduction of it, where the 
dot pattern becomes a shaded half-tone.

<p>
A Dynabook could link up with other Dynabooks,
with library facilities, with the telephone,
and it could go and hide where a child hides.
Alan is determined to keep the cost below $500
so that school systems could provide Dynabooks free out 
of their textbook budgets.
If Xerox Corporation decides to go with the concept,
the Dynabooks could be available in two or three years,
but that's up to Product Development, not Alan or the
Research Center. 

Peter Deutsch comments:
"Processors and memories are getting smaller and cheaper.
Five years ago the idea of the Dynabook would have been a
absolutely ridiculous. Now it merely seems difficult....

The emergence of computers into society at large
has come from a completely different quarter than you'd expect, namely
the small calculating machine manufacturers. The current ultimate step
in that direction is the Hewlett-Packard Pocket Calculator. They
sell for $400, and they're essentially a small computer with no
program and very little storage. Wang Laboratories makes cal-
. culators which are really computers in all but name  -  they're
progra~ª~ble; they have lots of storage.... But still these things
only reach thousands of people, not millions. They'll reach millions
when computer power becomes like telephone power.... I think it's
important to bring computing to the people." er a 

<h2>
Counter-computer
</h2>

How mass use of
computers might go is not even slightly known as yet, except for
obviousus applications in the schools. One informative place to
inquire is among the hackers, particularly at night when they're
pursuing their own interests.

<p>
One night at a computer center (nameless) 
I wandered off from the Spacewar game to a clattering
printout machine where a (nameless) young man with a trim beard was
scanning columns of entries like,
"Pam $1.59, Bud $14.75, Annie $2.66."
He was an employee taking advantage of unbusy after hours time
on the computer (computers are never turned off) to run his commune
accounts.

<p>
"Money seems to be a very sensitive issue," he explained,
"more sensitive than sex, even. People in the house who went on
vacation for a week didn't want to be charged for the food during that
time and so forth. It was taking me hours and hours every month to
figure out people's house bills. Now it takes about a half hour a
month. Every week I stick up a list on the refrigerator, and anyone
who buys food or anything for the house writes it down on the
list. I type all that into the computer, along with the mortgage
payment and the phone bills and the gas bill. The House Bill Program
goes around and divides up the common charges and adds in all the
special charges and figures out exactly who owes who how much. Each
person at the end of the month gets a bill plus a complete breakdown
of what their money goes to"

<p>
What else goes on around here in moonlight mode? "A friend of 
mine has his recording tape library index on the computer.
Everyone does their term papers and 
their theses on it. It'll justify margins,
incorporate corrections, handle illustrations, paging, 
footnotes, headings, indexing.... Two years ago when we had
the great faculty strike against the War,
we rigged up a program that would type out a form letter
to all your congressmen and type 
in your name and address. 

<p>
"Bruce is working on an astrology program. You put in your 
birthplace and date, down to the minute, and it gives you 
all your aspects, your chart. You can get 
your progress chart too... One of the hackers is building
a computer at home out of Army surplus parts,
and he's using the facilities here to help his design,
because we have this huge battery of 
computer design programs." 

<p>
Indeed. Far beyond borrowing some
one else's computer is having your own computer.
Hear now the saga of Pam Hart and Resource One.
In 1969 Pam was a computer programmer at Berkeley
who found the work "just too disillusioning. Then during
the Cambodia, Invasion demonstrations in Berkeley a group of us got
together and designed a retrieval program for coordinating all of the
actions on campus. It was a fairly dead system, but what it-did was it
brought together people who had never worked together before and
started them talking and thinking about how it was actually possible
to do something positive with technology,
when <i>you</i> define the goals."

<p>
Computing power to the people.
So began one of the great hustles of
modern times. Peter Deutsch is still awed: . "Pam could.hustle blood
from a turnip." She speaks quietly in a hasty, gentle, self-effacing
murmur. You have to lean close to hear the lady helping you help her
to plant dynamite in the very heart of the Combine.

<p>
<img src=gorin.jpg alt="Collage: Ralph Gorin, Pam Hart" align=left>

"Four of us came'
from Berkeley to Project One and set up in a little office
on the second floor. (Project One is a factory warehouse in the
south-of-Market area of San Francisco. It started in 1970 with a
radio announcement"' "If you're interested in building a community and
cheap space and sharing resources, come to Project One." Within two
weeks the building was filled with 200 artists, craftsmen, technicians
and ex-professionals, and their families.] We worked, on designing a
retrieval system so all the switchboards in the City could interact,
using a common data base, with all the care taken for privacy and
knowing who put stuff in so you could refer back. Hopefully you could
generate lists that were updated and be as on-line as possible.

<p>
"We found that it just did not work using borrowed time, stolen time,
bought time - we couldn't afford it.
So about a year later we set about getting surplus.
After a couple of months of calling everybody
in San Francisco that w.as related to computers, Trans-America said
that they had three XDS 940s in a warehouse [each costing $300,000 new]

<p>
"We negotiated the contract, got a '940 [free] which we refurbished;
It arrived last April; we installed it in June. It was probably the
fastest machine installation ever. We had it up in three days. We
were really fortunate the whole time. We had a lot of people from
Xerox Park, a lot of the old people from Berkeley Computer
Corporation, that have assisted us in areas where we weren't totally
sure of the appropriate thing to do ourselves. Peter Deutsch brought
up the operating system.

<p>
"Now we're a little more stable
economically. We got a foundation grant . of $10,000 last November
from Stern. Then we borrowed $8000 from the Whole Earth Catalog, of
which we paid back six. [News to me, This was part of the $20,000 I
had turned over to the mob at the Catalog Demise Party. One Fred Moore
finally signed for $15,000 of it and ran a series of subsequent
consensus money decidings, which evidently were susceptible to Pam's
soft voice and clear head.] After two years we're right there at the
beginning point of actually being able to do the things that we said
we wanted to do.

<p>
"One of the first things we have to do is have a
retrieval system that's general enough that it can handle things like
Switchboard referral information, also people who are doing
investigative work on corporations, people doing research on
foundations, a whole lot of different groups either willing or not
willing to share data bases.

<p>
"We're interested in some health care
statistical systems. There are a lot of Free. Clinics in the city, and
they 'have to do all of their work by hand. We want to incorporate a
system'doing statistical work for the clinics, charging the Health
Centers that have money and not charging the Free Clinics that don't
have money.

<p>
"A third area is using government generated tapes like
assessor'.s tapes and census tapes, and start trying to do some
analysis of the city. And the education program. The ideas include
what Dymax is doing  -  set up a little recreation center where
people could .come and play games and hopefully some of them would be
learning games. And then I'm interested in doing community education
with video tape. People want to know about computers, not how to use
them, necessarily, but how they're used against them."

<p>
Counter-computer. At present there are ten people in the 
core group at Resource One ranging in age from 19 to 30 (Pam is 25),
with decisions made by consensus.

<p>
Another scheme in the works 
involves the people around Steve Beck at the National Center
for Experiments in Television a few blocks away. 
Steve has built the world's first real-time video synthesizer - the video 
equivalent of the Moogs, Buchlas, and Arps of music synthesis.
It's a natural to link up with a computer. 
The current plan is for Steve and his equipment
to move into the basement below Resource One,
which should liven up the scene - Pam's gang 
is short on true hacker time-wasting frivolity;
they're warm, but rather stodgier than some of the Government-funded folks. 
Maybe the video link-up will give us some higher
levels of Spacewar on the way to exploring new territory entirely.
If I were a computer manufacturer I'd pay the closest attention and maybe
donate some goodies.

<h2>
Control and Spontaneity
</h2>

I&rsquo;m no manufacturer, but I&rsquo;m a hungry enough potential
user to pretend briefly that I know what I&rsquo;m talking about and run a
trial polemic...

<p>
Until computers come to the people we will have no
real idea of their most natural functions. Up to the present their
cost and size has kept them in the province of rich and powerful
institutions, who, understandably, have developed them primarily
as bookkeeping, sorting and control devices. The computers have
been a priceless aid in keeping the lid on top-down organization. They
are splendidly impressive as oracles of (programmable) Truth, the
lofty voice of unchangeable authority.

<p>
In fact, computers don&rsquo;t know shit.
Their special talent in the direction of intelligence is the
ability to make elabrate models and fiddle with them, to I
answer in detail questions that begin &ldquo;What if ..?&rdquo; In this they
parallel (and can help) the acquiring of intelligence by children. But
the basic fact of computer use is &ldquo;Garbage In, Garbage Out&rdquo;  -  if
you feed the computer nonsense, it will dutifully convert your mistake into insanity-cubed and feed it back to you. Children are
different  -  &ldquo;Garbage In, Food Out&rdquo; is common with them. Again, the
benefits of variant parallel systems. Computer function is
mostly one-track-mind, in which inconsistency is intolerable. The human mind functions on multiple tracks (not all of them accessible); it
can tolerate and even thrive on inconsistency.

<p>
I suggest that the parallel holds for the overall picture of computer use.
Where a few brilliantly stupid computers can wreak havoc,
a host of modest computers (and some brilliant ones) serving innumerable
individual purposes can be healthful, can repair havoc, feed life.
(Likewise, 20 crummy speakers at once will give better sound
fidelity than one excellent speaker  -  try it.)

<p>
Spacewar serves Earthpeace.
So does any funky playing with computers or any
computer-pursuit of your own peculiar goals, and especially any use of
computers to offset other computers. It won't be so hard. The price of
hardware is coming down fast, and with the new CMOS chips
(Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor integrated circuits) the
energy-drain of major computing drops to Flashlight-battery
level.

<p>
Part of the grotesqueness of American life in these latter days
is a subservience to Plan that amounts to panic.
What we don't intend shouldn't happen.
What happens anyway is either blamed on our enemies or baldly ignored.
In our arrogance we close our ears to voices not our rational own,
we routinely reject the princely gifts of spontaneous generation.

<p>
Spacewar as a parable is almost too pat. It was the illegitimate child 
of the marrying of computers and graphic displays. It was part of no one's grand scheme. It 
served no grand theory. It was the enthusiasm of irresponsible youngsters. It was disreputably 
competitive ("You killed me, Tovar!"). It was an administrative headache. It was merely 
delightful.

<p>
Yet Spacewar, if anyone cared to notice,
was a flawless crystal ball of things to come 
in computer science and computer use:

<ol>
<li> It was intensely interactive in real time with the computer.

<li> It encouraged new programming by the user.

<li> It bonded human and machine through a responsive
broadband interface of live graphics display. 

<li> It served primarily as a communication device
between humans. 

<li> It was a game.

<li> It functioned best on, stand-alone equipment 
(and diarupted multiple-user equipment). 

<li> It served human interest, not machine.
(Spacewar is trivial to a computer.) 

<li> It was delightful.
</ol>

<p>
In those days of batch processing and passive consumerism 
(data was something you sent to the manufacturer, like color film),
Spaccwar was heresy, uninvited and unwelcome.
The hackers made Spacewar, not the planners.
When computers become available to everybody, the hackers take over.
We are all Computer Bums, all more empowered as individuals
and as co-operators. That might enhance things ... 
like the richness and rigor of spontaneous creation and
of human interaction ... of sentient interaction.

Access to Computers
</h2>

As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Moorer">Andy Moorer</a> puts it,
&ldquo;Basically all you have to do is read a book on computer programming,
and you're an instant computer scientist.&rdquo; Alan Kay insists
that most of computer science can be mastered in one year
of close attention. That's how young a science it is.
<p>
The main thing is getting with computers.
If you live near a university or have family
in a business that uses cpmputers, you may be able to wangle moonlight
time and informal instruction.

<p>
If you&rsquo;re in school (college, high school, grade or Free)
it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to con them into buying ,
aome decent equipment  -  tell them they can use it for
school accounts at night. According to <a href="http://iae-pedia.org/Robert_Albrecht">Bob Albrecht</a> of Dymax (People&rsquo;s
Computer Company), the best school computers are from DEC and H-P:
&ldquo;Both of these companies have made a real commitment. They have

credibility.&rdquo; Write to:

  three families of computers ranging from
  a single-terminal PDP-8 ($7K [$7000]; can handle up to
  16 terminals) to the big PDP-10 ($500K). And H-P has their
  2000-series, ranging from " the 2000E ($50K) to the 2000C
  ($300K).
  
<p>

Some school systems are starting miniature ARPA Nets
 Bob Albrecht reports, "Minnesota may become the first
state to have a statewide network where every kid
will have access to a computer. 
There are more than 200 schools
and 50,000 kids already tied into the network. And Long Island 
has a consortium with 40 schools on a PDP-10."

Finally, there are starting to be places
where one can step in off the street and compute, and some 
of these have newsletters, games, etc., that they can send you.

If you're looking for good computer science in a college,
the best is Carnegie-Mellon at Pittsburgh,
then Stanford and MIT, with Utah, Cal Tech,
and Illinois following. The college that 
exposes more of its students to computer
use than anyone is Dartmouth.


<h2>
Appendix Two:<br>
Your Own Spacewar
</h2>

<p>
Though no one has done it yet, Alan Kay is
convinced a modest Spacewar could be built cheap: &ldquo;You can do motion
with a couple of integrators. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit">Heathkit</a> has this l6-integrator analogue
computer you can build as a kit for 700 bucks or something like
that. You have to have two layers of integrators to get an
inverse-square law, so you should be able to get gravity and orbits with
that one. To make spaceship outlines and explosion patterns you need
a few bits of digital memory. Two chips worth of register file should
do it. I think electronics stores may carry the chips. 

<p>
&ldquo;The controls for Spacewar are trivial.
The simplest way is to go to a radio control store  -  like 
for model airplanes  -  and get the front end
of the radio controller, which has two sets of joysticks and the
pots and everything else. You can use those as the inputs to the analogue 
computer. They only cost something like thirty bucks.&rdquo; 
Once you have the computer, your own or someone else&rsquo;s,
you can write your own Spacewar program or start with this one of Kay&rsquo;s:
